title: 'Babaspeak: Paradigm shifts and kickboxing'

Senior Bhakta was asked by a new joinee in the ranks of IIMBaba disciples: “Dude, how can I become a good management professional like you?”. Sr. Bhakta promised to look out for specific areas of improvement.

 After a couple of weeks, Sr. Bhakta gave a personalized tip that reeked of long hours of observation: “Dude, you have an awful long way to go. For starters, you might want to stop wincing when you come across words like ‘paradigm shift’ being used earnestly, especially by senior people”.

 Junior Bhakta, when last seen, was practicing kickboxing (primarily getting kicked in the gut) with a grim determination on his face. No flinching.
