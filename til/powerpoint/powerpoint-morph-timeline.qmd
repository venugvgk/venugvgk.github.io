timeline can become very interesting with this morphing. 

If images are copied across slides, and moved, morph makes them look like they move. 

Select all the slides where such images are and then apply morph. 

Unrelated images can be morphed by naming them the same in the animation pane. The name has to start with !! (two exclamation marks).

character morph makes it look like the words disintegrate into letters and letters rearrange themselves.
