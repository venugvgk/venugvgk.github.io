As I turn Forty Three<br>
———————————\-

Oh, yeah, on this birthday,<br>
Come let’s look at me<br>
Talk about what we see…

One more year gone by, it could be five,<br>
Ten more stones added to the frame<br>
Much more salt than pepper in hair,

Selfish, critical and needy, <br>
Others and I continue to be,<br>
We say we love, and most times<br>
Mean, “please, please, love me!”

And the work I do, oh, the work I do<br>
It’s put on such high pedestal<br>
Sometimes I wish to jump and run away…

Oh, yeah, it’s another birthday<br>
Come let’s look at me,<br>
As I turn forty three!
