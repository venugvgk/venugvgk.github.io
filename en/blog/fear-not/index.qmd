---

Through whichever path we arrive at it – religion, academic philosophy, all the other sciences, or our lived experience, compassion for each other, and other things arising from it, seem to be the way forward.

 How many wars will be fought, how much blood, how many tears will flow and how much does humanity – as a whole and in parts, collectively or separately – suffer, before everyone – those who still remain sane – see this, is the only question.
