title: On Teaching

Teaching is not about repeating what you learnt the way you were taught. It is about passing along your understanding/experience in a way that makes sense to others.

 Was listening to music lesson/awareness session by Rama Verma when this popped into head â€“ this is the difference between traditional music teaching and his.

 On another note : Those familiar with indian poetic tradition know that almost all poets worth the name have written about what poetry should be. I wish teachers would do the same for teaching.
