Hastings believed people had a right to be governed by their own laws. The company under Hastings also did not allow missionaries to open schools in India. They did not want the preaching of Christian missionaries to inflame Indian opinion.

Lord William Bentinck accepted the minute and the English Education Act of 1835 was legislated. In 1837, English was adopted as the language of courts of law and in 1844, high posts were thrown open to Indians. This eventually led to English education taking off in the country.
