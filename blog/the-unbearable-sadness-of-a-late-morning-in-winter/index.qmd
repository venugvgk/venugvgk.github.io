title: The unbearable sadness of a late morning inÂ winter
---

I can hear the birds sing,<br>
Even as it is late in the morning<br>
The trees still be shrouded in mist<br>
And the sun would be shining through<br>
Even as my windows are still shut

 The light filters through the glass<br>
Bringing in a slight warmth<br>
My feet are paining, legs weary,<br>
eyes on fire<br>
And I can feel that shard<br>
of a casual, uncharitable thought<br>
Lodged firmly in the heart

 Wish I could shut out the light<br>
I may live better with the shadows,<br>
but there are no curtains, on my windows.<br>
