I have always been fascinated by the idea of code that writes code. Found an opportunity to do this and feel awesome!

I wrote about how I used [revealjs to display a picture book](til\quarto\reading-book-revealjs.qmd). That book was in English. I wrote a copy of the book in Telugu. Now I needed to put that book also online. 

revealjs code is a header and just a long list of names of jpg files. So, I decided to write this python to generate the revealjs code. My jpg files are in the folder named pictures. 

```python

import os
from natsort import os_sorted
path= "/pictures"
file_names = os_sorted(os.listdir(path))
print(file_names) #just to check things are working ok
f = open("reveal.txt", "w")
for name in file_names:
    f = open("reveal.txt", "a")
    f.write("\n##\n\n![]" + name + "\n")
f.close()

```
that read the names of all the files in the folder and generated a text file which had entries like:

```
##

```
All I needed was to open a .qmd file, add the header and be done!

and yeah, that 'natsort' thing helps put numbers in natural sorting order. Otherwise, python does this thing where 1 is followed by 10 to 19 and then 2 is followed by 21 to 29 and so on.
