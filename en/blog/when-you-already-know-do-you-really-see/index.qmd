title: When you already ‘know’, do you really ‘see’?
---

<br>
 I was waking in the garden when I noticed the bees and the flowers. I called one of the children over, to show her.

 I said, “look!” I was very happy we got the opportunity to see the bees in action. I was thinking: ‘here is something she might have read about, how exciting to see it in real life!!’

 ![](img_20191216_105239222_hdr7678031098082000394.jpg) She came. She took one look. And said, “pollination”. Matter of fact. Only the shrug of indifference was missing.

 I tried again. Prompted her to move to a different position, see a different bee in a different flower. The same expression.

 Meanwhile, the bees buzzed off.

 ![](img_20191216_1054058847473859501657875297.jpg) Then I ask, “did you see how the bee was holding it’s feet as it hovered around the flower?”<br>
 “No.”<br>
 “Did you notice how fast it’s wings were moving?”<br>
 “No.”<br>
 “Did the bee have circles around it’s abdomen?”<br>
 “I didn’t notice.”

 I probe further. “Why not?” And a few more words.<br>
 “I didn’t notice because I knew”.

 “What did you know?”<br>
 “Pollination”<br>
 “How did you know?”<br>
 “I read it in a book”<br>
 “Did you ever really see it before?”<br>
 “No.”<br>
 “Did you observe now?”<br>
 “No”<br>
 “And that’s because?”<br>
 “I already knew!!”

 “What did you really know?”<br>
 “That it’s called pollination”

 “If a child did not know that word, and was seeing it for the first time, what would she have done?”<br>
 “I don’t know”<br>
 “Would she have observed more than you did?”<br>
 “I think so.”<br>
 And a few more such questions.

 “So what did knowing the name really do to you?”<br>
 “It stopped me from observing.”

 There you go.

 I had heard this for the first time in a dialogue session at a J.K. inspired school: “once you know it is a crow, do you actually continue to see?”
