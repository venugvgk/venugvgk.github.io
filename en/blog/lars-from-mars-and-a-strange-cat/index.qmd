title: Lars from Mars and a strangeÂ cat

In the course of doing poetry with a couple of middle school students, ended up writing the following. Do let me know what your youngsters think. ðŸ˜Š

 Lars from Mars

 There was a big boy called Lars<br>
He was from the red planet Mars<br>
He came in a ship<br>
To earth on a trip<br>
Never left, for he liked the cars.

 The Strange Cat

 I once knew a strange cat<br>
She didnâ€™t like the taste of rat

 She also didnâ€™t drink much milk<br>
Was so different from her ilk

 When angry, she actually barked<br>
All the other cats were so shocked

 She was scared of even small height<br>
And she was very very overweight

 One dark night she went for a walk<br>
And alas, she never ever came back!
