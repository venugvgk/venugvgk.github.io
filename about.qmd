# Profile Summary

I am a nonprofit leader focused on building and running high-performance teams in the education/alternative living space. 

Currently, I lead [Farm Hill Education Trust](https://farmhill.in) (FHT), a non-profit working in the areas of education, neurodiversity and community. Through FHT, we run [Subodha Learning Community](https://subodha.farmhill.in), a homeschool support center and [Sambhavam Center for Autism](https://sambhavam-autism.com), an early intervention center, in Bangalore. We also run [Farm Hill Learning](https://farmhill-learning.org), a neurodiverse, close to nature learning community, near Hosur. 

As a freelance consultant, I also advise education firms and non-profit teams on organizational development, project formulation, implementation, monitoring and impact assessment.

In the past, I was a core member in an ed-tech startup team where I played an instrumental role in designing, implementing and selling an innovative assessment product for educational institutions.

Additionally, at different points during my professional career, I taught Electrical Engineering at undergraduate level, picked up an MBA at the IIM Bangalore, was a management consultant, became an Autism Dad, coached CAT students, wrote a couple of picture books for children and translated a few childrenâ€™s books into Telugu.
