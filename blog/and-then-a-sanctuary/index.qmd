title: And then, a sanctuary…
---

And then,

 In the middle of everything,<br>
The boulders, the climbing,<br>
Slippery slopes and thorns,<br>
In the middle of everything,

 ![](img_20200510_074616073_mp.jpg) A sanctuary opens it’s arms<br>
Offering you a brief respite,<br>
A small, green, slice of love,<br>
Where you can go to pieces.

 And then,

 In the middle of everything,<br>
The boulders, the climbing,<br>
Slippery slopes and thorns,<br>
In the middle of everything,

 You find the will to keep at it.
