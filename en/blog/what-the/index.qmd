title: What the…&@#$?!
---

I am not generally given to ranting in public about nonsense on TV shows and in newspapers. I prefer to avoid them, which is why I don’t have a TV at home and these days, don’t read the newspaper half the time.

 So, when I read this [post](http://greatbong.net/2010/10/19/rakhi-springer/) on ‘Rakhi Ka Insaaf’, I initially thought it was an elaborate joke by RTDM. I realize it sounds like naiveté but, as I said, it’s simply that I have been sheltered too long in a TV\-less home and have no exposure to the murky  depths that popular entertainment has been exploring.

 I had to google and watch a ‘[teaser](http://www.india-forums.com/video/ndtv-imagine/101989-rakhi-ka-insaaf-ep-01-teaser.htm)‘ (*highly disgusting content warning*) with my own eyes…un\-effing\-believable, I say. And I will stop now for the fear that I will end up stretching my vocabulary and testing your patience very sorely if I let loose.
