For Ganesha, we could name and count sixty different types of flowers at farm hill, and found a hundred when we went gathering!!

We made our own ganeshas with clay, decorated with flowers and listened to the story of Ganesha, the story of Krishna and Jambavan, and remembered Tilak who celebrated this festival to bring people together.

We also took the opportunity to learn more about the nature we live in, and spent some time talking about the flowers and leaves we found, what they are useful for and why we have them here.

Wish you all a happy, educative and mindful Ganesh Chaturthi!! 🙏🙏
