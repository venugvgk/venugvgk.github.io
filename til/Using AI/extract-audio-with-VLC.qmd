I have been using OBS to screen record my calls on meet. I find it easier to extract audio files and upload them to perplexity or notebooklm. Found VLC to be super useful for this. 

1. Open VLC. 
2. Select media>convert/save
3. Add a file and click convert/save
4. Choose profile as audio-mp3
5. Choose destination file - I usually use the original file name and "-audio". When there are multiple files, it automatically suggests adding "-converted" to all file names. 
6. Click start and you will be done in minutes, if not seconds!
