So far, I have added books that were already publiched so I added a page for each book with a picture, some description and a link to the publisher's website. 

Now, I have a book that is not published elsewhere and I wanted people to be able to read it on this website itself. I have all the pages of the book, each page as a separate jpg file. 

Opened a .qmd file and wrote this in the header. 

```yml
---
format:
  revealjs:
    transition: slide
    auto-stretch: true
    css: style.css
    width: 1120
    height: 800
---
```

The rest of the file is in this format.

```html
##

![](page1.jpg)

```

that's it and included a button with the link to this qmd in the book page. you can read the book [here](/books/own-picture-books/treekar-shomus/treekar.html). 

oh, also, there is no easy way to exit a revealjs presentation. Included a link on the last slide to the books page for people to come back. 

and I have a hearty chuckle thinking if anyone ever imagined revealjs being used to display children's picture books online!
