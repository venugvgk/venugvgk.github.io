title: The Michael Bailey Dildo Scandal
---

*EXPLICIT CONTENT WARNING, if you haven’t figured it out already! 🙂*

 On February 21, 2011, Michael Bailey, a tenured professor at the Northwestern University, who teaches an undergraduate course in “Human Sexuality” arranged an after\-class activity for his class of 600 students. *esquire* [reports](http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/northwestern-university-sex-5376740) “Bailey had invited two rather enthusiastic local couples to talk at an after\-class discussion about “networking for kinky people.” When they came into Ryan Auditorium, the students were finishing an educational video that questioned the existence of the female G\-spot, which is, somehow, a scientifically controversial subject these days. The guests wanted to assure everyone otherwise and asked Bailey if they could perform a little demonstration. He hesitated only briefly — maybe too briefly — before saying yes. But putting a condom on a banana this was not: After some warnings about the graphic nature of what they were going to see, the students watched a man pull out a motorized dildo — otherwise known as a “fucksaw” — and bring a woman to orgasm on stage.” Another account reports – “The professor alerted his students about this extraordinary show\-and\-tell session, and made clear that attendance was voluntary. The standard account has it that 120 or so of the 622 students enrolled in the course showed up.”

 A complete waste of time for everyone is what I think it is. [Here](http://ethicsaesthetics.blogspot.com/2011/03/ghost-of-alfred-kinsey.html) is a rather ritualistic commentary on the issue (yeah, finding such things and then writing righteous blog posts is a ritual of sorts).

 Now, the point of this post: Joseph Epstein, Professor Emeritus at Northwestern, wrote this [fantastic piece](http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/lower-education_554092.html?page=1) in *the weekly Standard (*got it via [Briggs](http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=3613))*.* Idiocy of Bailey and his ilk is, sometimes, pardonable for the quality of the comments it generates. That reminds me of [this letter](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article838537.ece) written by Rohinton Mistry in the “book banning” controversy spearheaded by the scion of Shiv Sena. Unfortunately, in this case, there is no excuse for the young Thackeray.
