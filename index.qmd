2. Curriculum design and teacher training: deeply involved in both activities at Farm Hill Learning. 

3. Consulting: advising education firms and non-profit teams on organizational development, project formulation, implementation, monitoring and impact assessment. 

4. Autism: working with families and individuals on the spectrum; leading teams of professionals providing services in the space; developing guides and resources

4. Writing and Translating: Writing for children in Telugu and English; translating poetry, fiction as well as non-fiction between Telugu and English

5. Research and learning: I am pursuing an M.A in education at Tata Institute of Social Sciences. My areas of interest are philosophy and sociology of education. 

In addition to these areas, I am deeply interested in various uses of technology - in teaching and learning and productivity. I also pursue literature in Telugu, Sanskrit, English and Tamil as a hobby. 

I am always on the lookout for learning opportunities, and collaborations with passionate people. Please get in touch!
