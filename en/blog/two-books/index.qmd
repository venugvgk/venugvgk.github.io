title: Two books
---

This weekend, I bought one book on Thiruvalluvar’s Kural and another one on Ghalib’s poetry, among many others.

One reason for me to choose these books was that both the books present the original text, with roman transliteration and then present the translation. I feel it is immensely helpful for people like me who have at least a passing familiarity with the source language.

Both have turned out to be excellent books.

The Book of Desire is a translation of the third part of Thirukkaral that deals with love, the first two are about virtue and wealth.

 ![](img_20240525_0924563697010739865024872.jpg) Thinking with Ghalib presents thirty couplets from his Ghazals, selected to exemplify his power as a source of knowledge, insight and wisdom. Each couplet is presented along with a translation, commentary and notes. It is really well done.

Not bad, no?
