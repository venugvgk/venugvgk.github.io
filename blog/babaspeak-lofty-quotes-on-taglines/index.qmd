title: 'Babaspeak: Lofty quotes on taglines'
---

IIMBaba spotted a lofty quote on Bhakta’s tagline – some ‘freedom, thought, mind, persistence, action, virtue, awake and alive, knowledge and wisdom’ types – and pinged to inquire as to what inspired such high thinking.

 After some perfunctory nay\-saying, Bhakta spit it out indignantly : “we had a presentation meeting yesterday with the client company. I had spent a whole couple of weeks (just imagine THAT!!) studying this industry…you know…I was sure of what I was talking about…and that useless XYZ\-B\-School\-graduate\-idiot of a CEO just turned down all the ‘next steps’ !”

 At once made aware of the futility of life as a  Management Guru, Baba quietly went invisible.
