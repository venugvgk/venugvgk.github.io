title: 'Babaspeak: Intelligence and Knowledge'
---

As the Bhakta, once more, prepared himself to tackle a hitherto\-unheard\-of problem in a hitherto\-unknown\-industry, IIMBaba (Registered Trademark)  sought to caution him.

 Baba said: “Bhakta, has it ever occurred to you that intelligence may (just may) eventually lead to knowledge but is not an immediate substitute for it?”

 And Bhakta, with oily\-smug politeness, queried back – “Baba, have you ever considered the possible existence of some thing called a super\-human\-intelligence?”
