In a jupyter notebook, spacebar was not working. With a little bit of experimentation I found shift+spacebar works but it is tedious to write.

Found that going to keyboard shortcuts, find everything that starts with space and resetting all keybindings helps. I don't know what other problems this is going to cause but it works for now.
