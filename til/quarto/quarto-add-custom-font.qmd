When writing in quarto, we usually do not worry about the font. such trivial decisions are left to the theme. 

however, part of my webpage is in Telugu. and the font chosen with cosmo theme was horrible to read. 
at the same time, I was reading through this excellent presentation on customizing quarto sites when this [set main font](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/set-mainfont) slide caught my eye. 

so i did what was recommended. 

imported a good to read telugu google font called mallanna ino the .scss

```
/*-- scss:defaults --*/

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mallanna&display=swap');

```

then, added it in my _quarto.yml.

```
format:
  html: 
    theme: 
      - cosmo
      - styles.scss
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
    mainfont: Nunito, Mallanna

```
that's it! now, all the telugu font is in mallanna.
