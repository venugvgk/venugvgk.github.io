    "text": "After a particularly lengthy discourse by IIMbaba, Senior Bhakta got hold of the Junior Baba (who was the Senior Bhakta before he jumped ship in to baba-hood) while coming out and proceeded to ‘try and summarize the discussion’, as was his habit, ‘just to see’ that he ‘understands it correctly’.\nHe concluded his summary with a question: “so, the bottom line of what the Baba was saying is that discovering and understanding oneself is the route to freedom and happiness. What has your experience been as a practitioner?”\nJunior Baba replied rather candidly, despite his impending baba-hood: “While I would take Baba’s word on such matters anyday, critical self exploration, at least in the initial stages, is very very far from happiness. There is very little prettiness for anyone to see there”"

    "text": "I have just finished reading Dead Beat: Lost Souls, Lucky Stiffs and The Perverse Pleasures of Obituaries by Marilyn Johnson. It’s an interesting book, written with obvious relish and enthusiasm. The author is an obit writer herself and writes mostly about the art/science of obituary writing, as understood and represented by a host of (apparently) well known obituary writers in the UK and the USA.\nThe subject of death, one would think, cannot be far when writing about obituaries. Surprisingly, The book steers completely clear of the topic. There is absolutely no philosophizing about life, death, meaning and all. I am willing to concede that an obituary is more about life than about death; but it is hard to imagine that not one of the obituary writers is interested in discussing Death, let alone confess to being captivated or motivated by the spectacle it can get to be. Or may be such morbid (!) thoughts get edited out!\nSo, the author focuses on the people who write obituaries – the trend setters, the game changers and their perspectives. For about half of the book it reads fine. And she gives some very good examples of witty and interesting obits. Then, more of the same. Then, she talks about her own obsession with obituaries, internet news groups dedicated to obituary writing and reading and fellow obit fans. At which point, I kind of lost the flow.\n(update: I must confess that the book made me curious about obituaries and I have been looking for good ones. I guess this one of His Honour James Pickles in The Telegraph would appeal to obit fans)\nGoing off on a tangent, one of the people whose obit she mentions is Michael Donaghy, an award winning poet and musician. I looked him up. Here is a link to one of his poems. Here is one more profile piece and more poems you can listen to. Guy writes deep, very deep.\nOne more tangent: The famous poets page link where I found Donaghy’s poem has a pane on the left with more names of famous poets. One of the names I did not recognize was that of Jack Prelutsky. so, I clicked on the name and found the following poem.\nBe Glad Your Nose is on Your Face by Jack Prelutsky Be glad your nose is on your face,\nnot pasted on some other place,\nfor if it were where it is not,\nyou might dislike your nose a lot.\nImagine if your precious nose\nwere sandwiched in between your toes,\nthat clearly would not be a treat,\nfor you’d be forced to smell your feet.\nYour nose would be a source of dread\nwere it attached atop your head,\nit soon would drive you to despair,\nforever tickled by your hair.\nWithin your ear, your nose would be\nan absolute catastrophe,\nfor when you were obliged to sneeze,\nyour brain would rattle from the breeze.\nYour nose, instead, through thick and thin,\nremains between your eyes and chin,\nnot pasted on some other place–\nbe glad your nose is on your face!\nBrilliant, I say! More of the same here. While we are on brilliant poetry, let me present one more.\nIn the instantaneous silence,\nI closed my eyes for a moment\nIn the shade of a blue cliff\nIn the middle of a vast wilderness\nA small tick ticking sound\nAnd a wink winking blink\nA creepy smell of burning\nAnd a hint of malevolence\nThe blue cliff gave off a roar\nTick ticking is now burr burring\nThe wink winking waned off\nThe monsters have materialized\nGot to go, the light has turned green.\nThe identity of the poet will be revealed on request, after running a background check to ascertain your intentions. Please put your request in the comments section."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have never been great at math. Even as I was preparing for my engineering entrance exams, Math was my weakest subject – in my board exams, I scored the least in Math.\nLater in life, as I did my engineering, as I taught both math and engineering, and as I used more and more math, I found it fascinating.\nThe reason I was bad at math is rather obvious to everyone who studied it while growing up – bad design of the math programs and bad teaching. But which specific aspect of bad design and teaching impacted me most negatively?\nI will then have to pick the way different aspects and techniques were presented, without any focus on the underlying connections between them. Algebra is presented as a mystery science by itself. Calculus does not start with the problem of finding the area under the curve. I got to hear of fluxions late life. Pi is presented as an empirical constant related to the circle, infinite series just appear out of nowhere and many many more beautiful connections that would bring out the beauty of high school math, are totally ignored.\nAt farm hill, when I started teaching math about a couple of years back, I I decided to see if these connections can be highlighted and I am glad to report that my three students like the approach.\nOne of the ways I found to make this work is to ask myself, “how did the first person who thought of this, go about doing it?” And modify it to suit the context. When I took this approach, I saw how much of the beauty of math we have destroyed in adopting it to be taught easily (easy for the teahcers) in small chunks.\nThat’s enough of the rant. Let me present a couple of thoughts on how one can go about this, in middle school (Grades 6 to 8). Oh, by the way, I was also kind of pushed to this way because my students hated math, to start with. \nMy go to method is guided discovery, sessions are interactive, and interactions are socratic. So whenever I say show or establish or lead to, I mean it can be done through an interactive discussion and not as a capsule pushed down the throat.\nAlso, please note this is written as a quick note for fellow teaching learning enthusiasts. Treat the writing below accordingly.\n—-–————– Introduction\nWe start with geometry first. Start with a point, line as a collection of points, plane as a collection of lines, solids as collections of planes.\nThen, since we start with plane geometry, we examine the way two lines can be arranged in a plane. Quick to see that either they are parallel or they intersect.\nFrom intersecting lines, establish the idea of an angle as the rotational distance between lines, the idea of a straight angle, and the idea that opposite angles are equal. Park parallel lines for now.\nNow, consider bringing in another line into this plane. Again, quickly see that either the lines are (a) all parallel to each other (b) two are parallel and third intersects as a transversal (c) all intersect at the same point or (d) two lines intersect at a time to make a triangle\nPark a and c above for now.\nChoosing b, and using the ideas from two intersecting lines, establish the bunch of ideas around the angles formed – corresponding angles are equal, internal angles on the same side add to a straight angle, opposite internal angles are equal etc.\nNow, choose case d. The triangle is the first closed figure that can be formed on a plane, using straight lines. Have students draw different kinds of triangles, cut them out and arrange the angles together to make a straight angle. Let them experiment with triangles of various sizes and shapes. Let them see that however they make the triangle, the angles can be arranged along a straight line.\nNow, let’s ask if this would be true for all the triangles. Here, we can discuss the ideas of empirical results and mathematical proof. Yes, we have seen that the 15-20 triangles you made all have angles that can be arranged along a straight line. Based on this, are we really allowed to conclude this will be the same for all triangles? May be we cannot. May be there will a triangle whose angles are not along a straight line. How do we know for sure?\nAt this point, if you have the time or energy, talk about how we do this in”science”. For example, when do we decide a medicine is a good cure for cold? We conduct an experiment and if enough number of people get cured, we recommend it as a cure. Obviously that kind of logic does not work in mathematics. Why?\nNow, illustrate a math proof. Construct a fourth line parallel to any one of the lines and use the results from two intersecting lines case and two parallel lines and a transversal case above to show that the angles of any triangle, can be arranged along a straight line.\nTalk about how this remains true for all traingles.\nStrand 1.1 angles in polygons\nIn this strand, we continue to focus on the angles in closed figures. Now that we have shown the angles in a triangle can be arranged along a straight line, what can we say about angles in a quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon and so on?\nDraw a quadrilateral and show it can be divided into two traingles. Draw polygons with increasing number of sides and show that each time one more side is added, we add the angles of a triangle to the figure. Hint: drawing cyclic polygons makes this easy to show.\nBranch 1:\nMake a table of number of sides of a polygon and the number of staight angles in it. 3 sides will be one straight angle and there after, for every new side, an additional straight angle is added. You can treat this as a sequence and write down the general formula that can generate the sequence.\nBranch 2:\nGo back to the cyclic polygons and show that a polygon of n sides can be didived into n triangles, with the vertices of all the triangle at any point inside the polygon. These triangles bring in n straight angles. However, this also includes the two straight angles made at the point where the vertices are meeting. These two straight angles are not part of the intenral angles of the polygon, and need to be subtracted. We get the same formula as in branch 2 again.\nPoint out that the two straight angles at the center remain the same for any polygon, irrespective of the number of triangles.\nSpend sometime distinguishing the approaches between branch 1 above and here. Which of these is mathematically more robust?\nStrand 1.2 Areas\nStart with a rectangle, the next closed figure. Show that multiplying the two sides is the same as counting the number of unit squares covered by the rectangle.\nNow, go back to the triangle and ask how to find the area. Draw a right angled triangle and show that it is half of a rectangle. Draw any triangle, and show that a rectangle can always be constructed such that the area of the rectangle is double the area of the triangle. And so, get the formula for the area of the triangle.\nContinue to show that the area of any polygon can be calculated by dividing into triangles.\nContinue to different types of quadrilaterals like squares, parallelograms, trapeziums, kites etc., extending the ideas of area. Derive relevant formulae.\n——-++++++\nStrand 2 loci – parallel lines, perpendicular bisectors, circle\nParallel lines and locus\nStart with parallel lines. How do we know two lines are parallel? Lead to the idea that the distance between corresponding points on the lines has to stay the same.\nIn other words, if we pick up any point on a line and move it a fixed distance in any direction, and do the same for all points, we get a new line that is parallel to the original one.\nIntroduce the idea of points that move around following a rule. The above is an example.\nPerpendicular bisector and locus\nStart with another thought experiment. Let us say, two students are standing in a field. A third student has to stand in such a way that she is at an equal distance between them. Once she finds a point, ask if she can move, while keeping her distance from both the other students same. Slowly lead to the idea that there is an entire line on which she can stand, while following the equal distance rule.\nNow ask what is the angle between the line connecting the two students and the line on which the third student can move. Slowly lead to it being half of the straight angle. Now introduce the idea of the perpendicular and extend it to show that the line the third student moved on is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the two students.\nThis is the second example of a locus.\n Circle and locus\nAsk the students to draw a circle free hand. Discuss whether what they have drawn is really a circle and how they would improve the “roundness”. Suggest the idea of drawing a cross inside the circle to be able to draw a more round circle.\nHow can we improve the roundness of the circle further? By drawing more lines passing through the intersection of the cross. Let them draw and ask about the length of the lines drawn to make the circle more of a circle.\nArrive at the idea that the lines are all of the same length. Introduce the idea that the points on a circle are at a fixed distance from the point of intersection of all the lines drawn to make it more round.\nIntroduce the idea of the center and the radius/diameter. Discuss how a compass produces a circle. Talk about how construction workers draw circles using a rope tied to a fixed point.\nThis is the third example of locus.\nUsing the idea of locus to draw perpendicular bisector\nNow connect the following two ideas.\n1. Points on the perpendicular bisector of a line segment are at equal distances from the end points.\n2. Points on a circle are equidistant from the center.\nSlowly show that when circles with the same radius are drawn at the end points of a line segment, and they intersect, the two points of intersection of the circles are at the same distance from both the end points. So, these points are on the perpendicular bisector. Connecting these points gives us the perpendicular bisector of the line segment.\nA few ideas to emphasize:\nDrawing the circle is just to identify the points that are equidistant from the two end points. The usual method of drawing two arcs on either side of the line segment is the same as this.\nThe points need not be on either side of the line segment though. We can take a radius, draw two arcs with the end points of the line segment as centers that bisect on one side of the line segment, then change the radius and draw two more arcs that bisect on the same side. We still have two points on the perpendicular bisector. This will reinforce the idea of the properties of the points and take the focus away from the rote method.\nOnce students understand the idea of using arcs of a circle to identify equidistant points, a number of geometrical constructions become easy to figure out.\n“Practical geometry” chapters in NCERT textbooks for grades 7 and 8, where students learn to draw triangles and quadrilaterals are based on this idea.\n—–+++++++++\nStrand 3 Pythogorian triples and Pythagoras theorem\nStart with asking how would you build a perfect square in the field, as it requires creating a right angle. Ideas from the perpendicular bisector will come through here.\nIs drawing a perpendicular bisector feasible everywhere? Go on to talk about pyramids where you need to ensure a right angle at every corner as you go up the pyramid. Also, is there an easier way to do this?\nGo back to the perpendicular bisector and show that there are two right angles in the figure formed.\nThen show that a tringle once formed, the sides can always be reassembled in to the same triangle. This is not true for squares or rectangles.\nTherefore, once you build a right angle triangle, and note down the sides, you will be always be able to reassemble the triangle anywhere.\nWould it help if the sides of this right angle triangle we build are whole numbers? Yes, since whole number units are easier to measure and replicate.\nEncourage the students to experiment with right angle triangles of different sides, till they find three while numbers that form the sides of the triangle.\nHint: they can draw perpendicular bisector to one line segment, mark units on the two sides, and join the points in different ways. Using a graph sheet to this is easier still.\nThey will find 3, 4 and 5. Introduce the idea of pythogorean triplets. Show them how masons use this in the field to make right angles.\nIntroduce triangle numbers and square numbers. Show these as number series. Park this idea for further use when we come to dealing with number series.\nShow that pythogorean triples are formed when two squares are added to make another square.\nLead to the formal statement of pythogoras theorem.\n——++++++++++++\nBy now, we have covered triangles, rectangles, squares, other polygons, their sum of angles and areas. We have covered loci and circles. We have covered basic ideas of geometric constructions. Right angled triangles, pythogorean triples and pythogoras theorem are covered.\nNow, let’s introduce the idea of perimeter. Easy enough to write formulae.\nStrand 4 circle area and perimeter\nApproaching a new problem, using approximations, noticing patterns, the way one takes leaps of imagination – all of these can illustrated in this.\nDraw squares around..establish outer limits.\nArea is in square terms, perimeter is unit terms. Radius is the defining parameter of a circle. So formulas will be in terms of radius. So, intuitively it can be seen that the perimeter will be a linear function of the radius and areas will be a linear function of the radius square.\nEmpirical measures – draw circles of different radii on graph sheets. Find their perimeters using compass or thread. Find area by counting the squares.\nShow there is a linear relationship between radius and perimeter and a linear relationship betwee radius square and area, using the empirical measures.\nShow the more robust proof of the relationship between area and perimeter by cutting the circle up into sectors.\nCalculate the ratio of perimeter and radius, and area and radius, empirically.\nArchimedes – Show how an inscribed regular hexagon gives a better measure of the approximate area and perimeter. Show that a hexagon gives us a relationship between radius and the side of the inscribed polygon.\nHow about we draw bigger circles, more sided polygons and measure the area and perimeter? This was the preferred method to calculate constants in the area and perimeter functions.\nIntroduce Li hiu method. Uses right angle triangles and pythogoras theorem to calculate the area of a polygon that has double the sides of the hexagon, and so on.\nCalculate the value of Pi.\nStrand 5 – yet to be expanded\nNewton and Pi values. Binomial expansions, infinite series, areas under the curve. Integration. Differentiation."

    "text": "I rarely write about movies. Actually, Chitra and I watch movies rarely. The last one we watched together in a theatre was kahani in 2012. Yes, that rarely. And kahani came 8 years after the previous one.\nC/o kancharapalem was an experience worth that kind of wait. Starting from the opening credits song to the unexpected, yet strangely quietening, climax, it was riveting.\n What we noticed first was the costumes, the setting and the language, which were as authentic as the kallapi smell we grew up with. Then we noticed the performances were not at all canned or practiced and that’s what made them endearing. I remember having thought either these are all new actors or they are so good that they manage to ‘act’ like they are new to acting. Later I found from the internet that all but one of the actors are locals from the village. The team behind this must have had a very clear direction and vision to get such compelling performances from absolutely new people.\nAll of this vanished quickly from the mind as we were pulled into the story. The key characters are established quickly with bold strokes. There are no back stories, no annoying “narrator” trying to set the “tone”. We recognised so many of the incidents and characters – girls going around on bicycles, boys following them to and from home, uncles beating up romeos, bakery “parties” with veg puffs and cool drinks, pink color lyrics books…and the emotions – as chitra said in the interval – we felt strange with so many memories and emotions swirling around.\nWe also noticed and absolutely loved the lack of “fair”ness. Chitra said – “I wish there were more such movies with such people in them when I was growing up”. I am sure there would more than one dusky beauty thinking the same, watching this movie.\nIn the “second-aaff” the movie gets a little heavy but quickly moves on, warms up and turns out a heart warming, spirit lifting, hope filling, end.\nWhile I am thinking about it, there have been many movies that used realistic story telling but most of them are the dark and brooding variety. There have been movies that evoked nostalgia (‘naa autograph’ comes to mind) but this story is so much more authentic.\nOn a more autobiographical note, my bhargavi married her Joseph, so there will be no Radha-Raju to continue the story. But that’s also an occasion to think of the of the various “sunitha’s” in my life this morning and that fills my heart with happiness. If you don’t get this, go watch the movie ☺️\nOverall, the charm of the movie, for us, was that it showed us – reminded us – the life we lived and the loves we loved. What a movie!!\nThank you devulapalli and mohammed khadeerbabu for the wonderful reviews and shyam for the personal recommendations. We would really have .Missed the movie but for these."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Of late, I have been thinking about this book called ‘The Same Old Story’ by Ivan Goncharov. I had read that book really long back. Like, sometime when I was in high school – 1993-94, I think.\nLet’s get to the story now. I remember the gist of the story. The details are very sketchy in my mind.\nThere is this guy called A. Young, 16-18 years, full of hopes and dreams. He lives in a village or a small town. Spends his time lying under trees, looking at butterflies, writing poems and so on. Imagine your own romantic 16-year old self. That’s A.\nHe has to study further and see the world. So, his parents send him to stay with his uncle in Moscow (or was it St. Petersburg?). Okay, some big city where this uncle is living successfully – mid thirties, well paying government job, bachelor life, paunch, pompousness, and so on.\nA is living with his uncle and pretty soon starts thinking, rather critically, of his uncle’s life. He concludes that the uncle is spending his life uselessly. A wants to lead a romantic life. Steady, sedentary job, late night obligatory drinking, dreary social life are not for him. He wants to be free and happy.\nIn the course of a couple of years (or more), the uncle marries a young twenty-something. A becomes friends with the wife since they are almost in the same age group now. A fresh round of critical thinking follows now. What kind of a being marries some one so young and leaves her uncared for? Oh, if only A had a girl like her….he would make her happy beyond every dream. A still thinks of himself as the greatest-romantic-on-earth types and looks down upon people like his uncle with something like pity. Now, I am sorry if this dashes expectations but i dont remember any romance happening between the wife and A (it would have been juicy, no?).\nIn due course of time, A moves out of his uncle’s house, gets a job and one day makes a trip back home. The house is changed now. Everyting is old, rusty and musty. He starts looking for some of his papers and generally starts tidying up the place, as we all do when we go back home after a long time. The people living there don’t find any need to do so, but we do take everything out and air it once, don’t we?\nDuring the process, he comes across an old trunk crammed with papers. They are his uncle’s. The papers are full of poems, sketches and notes that A could recognise as the output of an incurable romantic. Here he discovers that the uncle, for all his dreary life now, was once as ardent a romantic as A himself was.\nThen, A thinks of his life in the big city. He is now thirtyish, works in a government office and drinks everyday at his club. It’s been at least a year since he took a long walk and the hideous looking paunch he has developed refuses to hide itself. And he is now looking forward to marry…a twenty-something girl.\nThat’s the same old story.\nLike I said, I had read this story when I was in high school. It’s made such a strong impression on me that I remember the gist till today. Though I can’t recall the names or the plot details, I think I got the idea right. I remember a number of occasions I thought about it or told people about it.Still, you know something doesn’t mean you understand it. You understand it doesn’t mean you will be able to do anything about it. You do something about it doesn’t mean you get the result you want. Even if you get the result you want, there is no telling how you end up feeling about it.\nIf you look back, look at yourself, think long and hard, and then look around, may be you will also see the pits around your’s, and recognize the metaphorical ‘uncles’ in them. But then, may be you are not as jobless (okay, any other adjective you please!) as I am…and, may be you don’ want to do all that.\nAnyway, it’s the same old story."

    "text": "I was waking in the garden when I noticed the bees and the flowers. I called one of the children over, to show her.\nI said, “look!” I was very happy we got the opportunity to see the bees in action. I was thinking: ‘here is something she might have read about, how exciting to see it in real life!!’\n She came. She took one look. And said, “pollination”. Matter of fact. Only the shrug of indifference was missing.\nI tried again. Prompted her to move to a different position, see a different bee in a different flower. The same expression.\nMeanwhile, the bees buzzed off.\n Then I ask, “did you see how the bee was holding it’s feet as it hovered around the flower?” “No.” “Did you notice how fast it’s wings were moving?” “No.” “Did the bee have circles around it’s abdomen?” “I didn’t notice.”\nI probe further. “Why not?” And a few more words. “I didn’t notice because I knew”.\n“What did you know?” “Pollination” “How did you know?” “I read it in a book” “Did you ever really see it before?” “No.” “Did you observe now?” “No” “And that’s because?” “I already knew!!”\n“What did you really know?” “That it’s called pollination”\n“If a child did not know that word, and was seeing it for the first time, what would she have done?” “I don’t know” “Would she have observed more than you did?” “I think so.” And a few more such questions.\n“So what did knowing the name really do to you?” “It stopped me from observing.”\nThere you go.\nI had heard this for the first time in a dialogue session at a J.K. inspired school: “once you know it is a crow, do you actually continue to see?”"

    "text": "As such, I love words. And these days I have been teaching Verbal Ability classes for CAT (I know, I know, what to do? One has to eat, no?) and GRE. So, I spend enough and more time on words.\nI thought there should be a word for a word-lover and hazarding a guess, came up with ‘Lexicophile’. When I fed the word to google, it told me the word is actually ‘Lexophile’ and this blog link came up. While there are more nuances to words apart from ‘plain, hilarious pun’, the collection on this page is very good and entertaining. I will put a couple of samples here now:\nThe Police were called to a daycare where a 3 year old was resisting a rest.\nSanta’s helpers are subordinate clauses.\nThe blog also said “The Wikipedia defines Lexophilia as the love of words and a Lexophile as a lover of words who generally appreciate the nuances surrounding different words “. Naturally I clicked on the Wikipedia link and it told me that the page is deleted. So, I looked it up in Wictionary and there, the suggested word for a love of words and word games is ‘Logophilia’.\nI think ‘lexophilia’ is better than ’logophilia’and therefore I am a Lexophile.\nAnyway, now that we settled on the nomenclature, there are some books that I want to talk about.\nThe first one is The meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd. This is what they have to say in the very short foreword:\nIn Life*, there are many hundreds of common experiences, feelings, situations and even objects which we all know and recognize, but for which no words exist. On the other hand, the world is littererd with thousands of spare words which spend their time doing nothing but loafing about on signposts pointing at places. Our job, as wee see it, is to get these words off the signposts and into the mouths of babes and sucklings and so on, where they can start earning their keep in everyday conversation and make a more positive contribution to society.\nDouglas Adams John Lloyd\n*And, indeed, in Liff.\nSome samples of the words that they come up with:\nBABWORTH (n.) Something which justifies having a really good cry.\nBOTCHERBY (n.) The principle by which British roads are signposted.\nGRINSTEAD (n.) The state of a lady’s clothing after she has been to powder her nose and has hitched up her tights over her skirt at the back, thus exposing her bottom, and has walked out without noticing it.\nLIFF (n.) A book, the contents of which are totally belied by its cover. For instance, any book the dust jacket of which bears the words. ‘This book will change your life’.\nLULWORTH (n.) Measure of conversation. A lulworth defines the amount of the length, loudness and embarrassment of a statement you make when everyone else in the room unaccountably stops talking at the same time\nI will now make an effort and stop putting more samples here…..Okay, two more.\nPELUTHO (n.) A South American ball game. The balls are whacked against a brick wall with a stout wooden bat until the prisoner confesses.\nSMARDEN (vb.) To keep your mouth shut by smiling determinedly through you teeth. Smardening is largely used by people trying to give the impression that they’re enjoying a story they’ve heard at least six times before.\nDone now. The next book is again an effort in lexicography – The Devils Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce. Here is the Wikipedia entry for some more background. Once again, I take the liberty of quoting.\nFrom the Preface:\nThe Devil’s Dictionary was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, and was continued in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906. In that year a large part of it was published in covers with the title The Cynic’s Word Book, a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve. To quote the publishers of the present work:\n“This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had appeared, with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the country already had been flooded by its imitators with a score of ‘cynic’ books—The Cynic’s This, The Cynic’s That, and The Cynic’s t’Other. Most of these books were merely stupid, though some of them added the distinction of silliness. Among them, they brought the word ‘cynic’ into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in advance of publication.”\nSome words from the book:\nARMOR, n. The kind of clothing worn by a man whose tailor is a blacksmith.\nOne entry after my own heart.\nBACCHUS, n. A convenient deity invented by the ancients as an excuse for getting drunk.\nJorace\nI must confess now that I looked up this word just now and it has adequately met my expectations.\nIDIOT, n. A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling. The Idiot’s activity is not confined to any special field of thought or action, but “pervades and regulates the whole.” He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line.\nSome entries are outright enlightening and some, at once pregnent with meaning.\nINK, n. A villainous compound of tannogallate of iron, gum-arabic and water, chiefly used to facilitate the infection of idiocy and promote intellectual crime. The properties of ink are peculiar and contradictory: it may be used to make reputations and unmake them; to blacken them and to make them white; but it is most generally and acceptably employed as a mortar to bind together the stones of an edifice of fame, and as a whitewash to conceal afterward the rascal quality of the material. There are men called journalists who have established ink baths which some persons pay money to get into, others to get out of. Not infrequently it occurs that a person who has paid to get in pays twice as much to get out.\nIMPIETY, n. Your irreverence toward my deity\nIMPUNITY, n. Wealth.\nLIBERTY, n. One of Imagination’s most precious possessions.\nMartha Braymance\nOkay. I will now have to stop for the fear that I will end of pasting the book here.\nThe third (and the last) book for the day is ‘Fantastic Fables’ by Ambrose Bierce. These are short pieces written with sardonic wit and sometimes, outright black humor. For those of you aspiring to crack the CAT and looking for the definition of satire, here it is.\nOne sample:"

This week, we have been striking out on our own, trying to climb hills along goat trails. These are small hills, by the way, and not adventurous climbs.\nToday, we climbed a different side of this hill, and we’re walking across a field. Suddenly, Srikar sidestepped and said, “look!”. There seemed to be a bird perched on the ground. I took the first picture.\n It was sitting completely quietly, had a few twigs about it, with one across it’s beak too! Its eyes were half closed and it was totally still. We recognised it was a nightjar. My first thought was that the poor bird was dead. I got a couple more close-up shots, and then it got up and flew away!!\n That’s when we noticed the egg it was hatching. We quickly left the place so as not to disturb it for the bird, hoping it will come back once we leave.\n Internet confirms that India nightjars roost on the ground, and can enter periods of torpor where they look sleepy or dead. They are also great at camouflage.\nGlad to have met this fellow and hope he is alright."

Each time, we can calculate the height of the triangle, identify the third vertex and go around. Then, the next circle radius will be current radius - the height of the triangle.\nTo implement this logic, we separate out the calculation of radius and the height into a separate function. Notice that this function returns two values in a list, and we use the values by specifiying the index of the list using [0] and [1].\nThe code looks like this.

Also, see how close this is to the colored mandala made with 24 circles.\n\nThere are significant differences too. The height of the triangles decreases outwards in one and inwards in the other. The mandala has circles in the center and then has triangles.\nNow that we know how to create circles and triangles on circles of various diameters, maybe next we can try to combine them and create a proper mandala!"

    "text": "I was an “Adventure Intern” at NALS, Coonoor – so were the wife, kid and the dog. That meant we got to spend time living and walking around in a tea estate and the jungle surrounding it for a month.\nWe had a morning off one day and I went around with my camera trying to spot and take pictures of birds. These are a few thoughts that might help you if you ever find yourself in a similar situation.\nBefore we go further, here is a sample picture of what I later found to be an oriental white eye.\n\n\n\nIMG_1981\n\n\nYou may think it would be easy to take bird pictures – just take your camera, go to the place from where you hear the birds and click away. In practice, if you just keep walking, you never reach the place where birds are chirping. After a while, you realize that you are moving within a sphere of silence. You can always hear the birds chirping, a little behind and a little ahead of you. You spot birds from a distance but you are never close enough to take a picture (unless you have like a 100x camera or something).\nThe trick is to spot the birds that interest you and note the bushes where you see them. Typically these are some kind of flowering bushes with fruits as well. Now sit or stand slightly far from the place. Just stand there – don’t walk around or make a noise. You don’t need to stand like a statue – you can shift weight from foot to foot and turn around to watch stuff. Just don’t move too much.\nAnother thing while choosing the place – the sun should be behind you. Else, you will end up getting silhouette pictures.\nYou will now find the chirping slowly getting nearer as the birds get accustomed to your presence and start moving about, coming near and making sounds. Typically this happens when you stand around long enough for the local flies, mosquitoes and gnats to find you and start irritating you.\nFirst, the boldest birds come back – in my case, it was red vented bulbuls. Then slowly, the other birds return and the bird you really want to take a picture of will come last. In this case at least, it is true that all things come to those who wait.\nOnce you spot a bird, you will note that they rarely stand still for a pose. Birds move constantly but once they are near a food source, they move in short bursts and move only a very short distance. Identify the general area in which the bird is moving, zoom in and follow the movement of the branches. You will eventually figure out the rhythm.\nInitially, shoot everything that moves – slowly you can start ignoring the ones you have covered. As a matter of fact, I found afterwards that two sun birds I thought were the same were actually two different types!\nA few other notes:\n\nLot of patience and a little luck are what you need.\nMurphy’s Law works like everywhere else – you see the best possible shots when you are the least prepared. The auto zoom camera you are using decides to switch off seconds before you see the shot.\nIt helps if you have a hiking stick or something to rest your hand on when you are taking the shot – else you will end up with blurry pictures\nBirds generally have a fall back position to quickly hide when someone is approaching. This is typically a little less visible than the feeding area. If you find that position and have a good zoom camera, you could get really good pictures\n\nThe approach above will help you cover the common types of sunbirds, bulbuls, barbets etc. For more exotic birds like woodpeckers and hoopoes, note the general area you spot them in and go back frequently. You could get lucky!\nDo let me know your thoughts and any other inputs you may have, in the comments."

    "text": "Single column news on the first page of The Hindu today:\n“Deadlock over prices issue ends”\nAccording to the report, a resolution is will be moved in both the houses expressing concern over inflationary pressure on the economy and calling up on the Centre to take steps to reduce its adverse impact on common man. And all these people have been fighting over the wording of the resolution. A discussion on this resolution is scheduled for today.\nI was already wondering why a week of collective energy has been wasted on this thing. “another report on page 12” revealed that perhaps this is the first time that such a resolution will be adopted on a subject like inflation. I thought may be this is a big thing and may be the week was not completely wasted.\nThen came the killer – “In recent memory resolutions were adopted on Kashmir being an integral part of India, on the 2002 Gujarat riots, and on the occupation of Iraq by the US”.\nDoes it matter?\nAnd come to think of it again, if they had not wasted that one week on this issue, what else could they have done? Pick a more appropriate issue to waste time on?"

    "text": "I spent half a life building a self, modelling it after the glimpses of images and reflections caught through a variety of lenses and mirrors.\nThe remaining half, I will spend deconstructing the self I have built, trying to transcend it in sane moments, and unconsciously conforming to it in the more frequent, routine ones.\nHow should I respond to it? When I consider this logically, it depends on how I think about this process.\nHaving noticed pretty much everyone has been going through this, pretty much since the beginning of time, if I, consciously or otherwise, subscribe to the idea that this could have been done better, I feel unhappy.\nOn the other hand, if I believe that this is a natural process, and that everyone has to go through it by himself and that’s the best way for it to happen, there is some chance of me accepting it and feeling comfortable about it.\nBut that’s the logic of it.\nThere is also an intuitive gut feel we have about this process. It’s not immutable – it is influenced by logic though it’s often a slow, roundabout process. The intuitive gut feel is also influenced by what we do and how things work out.\nIt’s the interaction of the logic, the action and the intuition that determines – in multiple, non-linear ways – how we respond to life. There may be some way of going about it, that can help us find a way out of the emotional bondage**.\n ————— ** The Gita bases it’s message of action on a philosophy of life. (…. ) It does not advocate a fanatical devotion to the practical, to the disparagement of the dignity of thought. It’s philosophy of the practical is a derivative from its philosophy of spirit, ब्रह्मविद्यान्तर्गत कर्मयोगशास्त्र। Ethical action is derived from metaphysical realization. Sankara urges that the essential purpose of the Gita is to teach us a way out of the bondage and not merely enjoin action, शोकमोहादिसंसारकर्मनिवृत्यर्थंगीताशास्त्रम् , न प्रवर्तकम्।\n– Professor S. Radhakrishnan, in the book “The Bhagavadgita”, 1948."

    "text": "The first time I came across Ian Rankin was while reading an account of the interaction between him and Prakash Karat titled “crime fiction is about social inequality” in The Hindu here. I know…but there are so many guys out there and it is hard to read them all.\nRecently, In Bangalore landmark I managed to find a Rankin book – strip jack. A couple of stores in Delhi, where I had tried earlier, did not have copies.\nIt’s a good story. Fast paced too. The language is slightly different from the american one is so used to. The book is a suspense thriller. I don’t need to say more than that.\nIn my library (a life time project, that…) I would put him along with Dick Francis and Harlen Coben (both of whom need to be written about separately).\nThe common theme is that they do not need psychopaths to create a good crime story. All three pay close attention to detail and the stories usually have a good plot and a very good narration. Their heroes have some kind of self deprecating humor with a subtle hint of strong personal philosophy. While Dick Francis’s heroes are very well educated, Rankin’s Rebus is not. Francis writes in a race course setting while Coben uses sports as the backdrop. Rebus is your regular police detective.\nI particularly like use of lines like “I am caught between a cushion and a soft place” – Rebus thinking about how he has grown comfortable with his job and life.\nThe other thing i liked was the mention of Genmorangie…in a pouring rain sequence, the inspector is offered a drink in a rich household, opens a cupboard and pours out a glass of Glenmorangie.This is the first time I have come across this drink mentioned in a book and this is one of the few drinks i have had that are mentioned in books – the others being Johny walker and Glenfiddich. I just love it when something like that happens. When I write a book, it is going to be full of people asking for a shot of McDowell’s Number One, Signature, Blender’s Pride or Royal Challenge. Yes…whiskey is my poison, if you please, and my birthday is on the day after tomorrow. Cheers!"

I feel it is immensely helpful for people like me who have at least a passing familiarity with the source language.\nBoth have turned out to be excellent books.\nThe Book of Desire is a translation of the third part of Thirukkaral that deals with love, the first two are about virtue and wealth.\n Thinking with Ghalib presents thirty couplets from his Ghazals, selected to exemplify his power as a source of knowledge, insight and wisdom. Each couplet is presented along with a translation, commentary and notes. It is really well done.\n I also realise now that I have chosen to read Kural on desire, love and longing, from a poet known primarily for his wisdom. And couplets on insight, knowledge and wisdom from a poet known for his poetry of love and longing.\nNot bad, no?"

He saw me reading the book, on and off, through out the day.\n\nIn the evening, he picks it up and reads the title slowly (he knows how to read Telugu script and understands most day today conversations. He doesn’t read or speak much in Telugu).\nHe tries to translate it – the threads I go round and round – translating దారులు as if it is దారాలు and translating తిరిగిన from the context of వానా వానా వల్లప్పా where he learnt తిరుగు meaning turning round and round.\nI am thrilled by this time. Here is a child who usually does not like to engage with any language other than English!\nI prompt him to read the line below the title. He translates అడవులు and కొండలు correctly but needs help with నదీనదాలు. We end up with a rough translation of the title – The Paths I Traveled; Rivers, Forests and Hills.\nI am happy by this time as this engagement with the book has come completely independently, from the child.\nThen he ventures further, “can you translate this book into English?”\n“Why?”\n“So that I can read it.” I get greedy. “Or you can learn Telugu, so you can read not just this book but also many other wonderful things I have read as a child.” For the first time, I see him pay serious attention to this proposition. “Can we translate this together?” “We can, but you will have to learn Telugu to work with me.” “I will learn while we translate.” I am thrilled beyond my wildest dreams by now.\nWe agree to start translating one of the recent stories he has written in English into Telugu, as this book would be difficult for him (truth be told, this one would be difficult for me too ☺️).\nAnd then, after 5 minutes, I ask him the question. “Have you seen me read books in Telugu before?” “Yes. Many times.” “You never picked up any of them. What made you pick it up and talk to me about it?” “The cover art. I also flipped through the book. The illustrations are interesting.”\nI don’t know about this. I think he has seen Telugu books with good looking illustrations before. That adds an interesting mystery as to why he really picked this up, and I am happy to let it be.\nNow, it’s his turn to get thrilled as I tell him that the person who wrote the book also did the cover painting and the inside illustrations. He says, “that’s just like me!”☺️.\nThank you Veerabhadrudu garu and a heart felt namaskaram. 🙏"

While I was thinking of fishing out some of them from old notebooks and putting them here, a golden opportunity/random happenstance came my way.\nKrishnamoorthy, a classmate from B-school and a good friend, sent me a poem (I use the term quite loosely, as you will figure out shortly).

    "text": "What a book…an excerpt is below.\nA few thoughts:\n1. Women had it rough, and continue to have it rough, not withstanding the wokeism around. Many women themselves continue to be blind. And no man, NO MAN, is as good in this matter as he sounds. So let’s stop with the sealioning, and start seeing it around us.\n2. Affirms my belief that the men from previous generations had an easier life, got away with much, time and time again depending on the women. The most liberal, secular and woke sounding of them, were no exceptions. It contributed to the achievements of the highest achievers as well.\n3. The demands on this generation of men, who grew up watching the previous, and imagining a similar life for themselves, are much greater. This is a much needed change, but boy, is it hard!! Most of us never learn to deal with this and that is contributing to a lot of strife in families.\n4. The demands on men will only increase as we go, and rightly so. What we have, is the opportunity to prepare our children. We must prepare them well, if they are to have happier lives.\nWe will get no where by pretending all is well and hiding the struggles we are facing, and refusing to better prepare our children.\nNow the excerpt:\n“We think we’ve come a long way in 80 years, but statistically, there is an irrefutable, globally intransigent heterosexual norm that pervades across ethnicity, colour and class. Nowhere in the world do women have the same power, freedom, leisure or money as their male partners. Every society is built on the unpaid or underpaid work of women, an estimated $10.9tn (£8.5tn) of it a year. But to pay would be to redistribute wealth and power in a way that might defund and defang patriarchy.\nThings in the rear-view mirror are closer than they appear.\nWhich reminds me, of course, of my own, unseen, unsung conditions of production. As my husband says, with a wry smile: “You couldn’t have written this book without me.” And he’s absolutely right.\nWifedom: Mrs Orwell’s Invisible Life by Anna Funder is published on 17 August by Viking (£20). “\nFull review from the guardian here"

    "text": "I was very surprised the other day to get an invitation to speak at the graduation day ceremony at Acharya Institutes of Management, but accepted out of curiosity. Must say I enjoyed it, don’t know about the people who had to sit through it. Here is a picture (I am the middle aged man in purple) and the text of the speech.\n\n\n\nIMG_1331\n\n\nGood morning.\nSome of you might already have suspected this but I wanted to share this with everyone – this is absolutely the first graduation day speech I am delivering. Thank you everyone for having me today.\nWhen I was asked to speak here, I thought ‘what would I want to say?’ and it looked like a big problem. Then, I used a technique I used often before – make the problem something that I can relate to. For example, if you ask ‘how can I solve the problem of world poverty?’, it looks like a big problem. But if you ask yourself ‘my neighbor is poor. How can I help her?’ – it becomes very relatable and solvable.\nSo, I asked myself ’I have a 10-year-old son – what would I want to tell him about life, and I found somethings I could say. So, Srikar, this speech is as much for you as it is for anyone else here.\nThere are two things that absolutely everyone I have ever met wanted in life – success and happiness. Please note that I have separated these two – being successful in something does not necessarily lead to happiness. You have to work separately for that.\nSo, let me spend the next few minutes talking about these.\nFirst, success:\nYou may define success whichever way you want – make more money, have an impact on the world, solve an important problem and so on. Whatever your definition of success, I have found 2-3 things to be very important for it.\nFirst, keep learning. There was a time when a 40-year-old would say ‘I am still a student’, and people would clap for it. Today, it is absolutely essential for each of us to keep learning. Things are changing so fast, you do not know what job you would be working at in 10 years’ time – in such a climate, as someone said, the ability to learn, unlearn and re-learn is going to define success in the future. You are graduating today with a degree but what you are going to learn in the future is going to be more important than what you have learnt till now.\nThat raises a question – so, what should we learn? Purely based on my experience with recruitment and training of fresh graduates, I would say, learn to communicate well in English. In my opinion, it is the single biggest factor that makes people ‘unemployable’. It is the first thing that people notice. I do not mean to say do not learn your mother tongue. It is not an either – or choice – learn both the languages. Many of the people I know who are very good at English are also very good at their mother tongue. Do not use your love of mother tongue as an excuse not to learn English.\nOther important things I would suggest – learn how to think, argue and make decisions, learn how to code, learn statistics, learn how to manage your money.\nSo, where and how to learn? Fortunately, today this question is easy to answer – use the internet – there was a time when you needed to go to a library or speak to a professor to learn anything. Today, you can learn anything on the internet. In my opinion, the importance of colleges and degrees is going to decrease drastically in the future. If you look at it, most of the cutting edge technologies like data science are not learnt in colleges. People are learning these on their own and learning on your own has become very easy. I would specifically recommend Coursera – an online platform where you can get free courses from world’s leading universities. For school going children, you should try Khan Academy and learnzillion to see what I mean about learning becoming very easy.\nSecond thing about success: Cultivate good working habits – be disciplined, develop that ability to plan and follow through, become reliable – in short, be more productive. The best way to learn these is by actually working. I would recommend you start working as early as possible, one way or the other. Do not wait till you finish your masters or Ph. D. Go volunteer with any organization, join as an intern, start some small thing of your own – but get started. Of course you can also look up how to be productive online and see which of them suit you.\nThird – this is at a slightly meta level – Treat life as a series of deliberate decisions rather than as a flow that you need to go along with – think carefully and make choices based on what you are getting out of each decision you make – As a concrete example, joining a master’s program after a bachelor degree should not be an automatic choice – you should first satisfy yourself that is the best option – for example, would a masters be better than interning at some startup?\nFourth – have some goals in life and periodically ask yourself how you are doing on these goals. Whenever you make a decision or take a step forward, ask yourself what you are trying to achieve, document it and see if you meet the goal. You can learn a lot by doing this. For example, let us say you are planning to party overnight. What is the goal? To have a good time. In the morning, ask yourself if you really had a good time. Take all things – effort to organize the party, money to pay for it, the hangover, the lies you had to tell – all of them, into account and ask yourself if that is what a good time is. If yes, do it again. If not, try something else next time.\nSecond, Happiness\nNow, let is come to happiness. Like I said, success and happiness do not automatically go together.\nSo, what should you do to stay happy?\nFirst, you need to be aware of yourself. It is not a cliché; it is not trivial. Think about this – you spend most of the time with yourself, in your head. And if you think about it, most of your unhappiness is about yourself. Most of your unhappiness is rooted in not being able to understand and accept yourself for what you are.\nFor example, say you have the habit of postponing everything – by the way, it is the most common unproductive habit around the world. How many people do you know who acknowledge this and take some steps to address this issue? I bet none.\nSo, you go on without recognizing you have this habit. You find yourself falling behind on a lot of things as you postpone things and every day you wake up feeling more and more unhappy about it.\nNow consider you are aware of this – you take some concrete steps like having well defined deadlines, asking friends to help you, making public commitments and so on. You will fail sometimes; you will succeed sometimes. Irrespective of that, you are definitely better off than in the other case, in terms of happiness.\nIt is not easy, but it is not impossible. It is important to start thinking about it and observing yourself.\nIn summary, what are your strengths and weaknesses should not be treated like a routine interview question – it is THE question on which a major portion of your happiness depends.\nSecond important point about happiness is relationships.\nIt does not make sense to conclude a speech to 19 – 20 year olds without talking about relationships.\nWhen I say relationships, most of you think oh, he is going to talk about ‘love’. So, let me spend a minute on that. What is love? – it is so notoriously difficult to express that someone just said – love is what two people agree it is. One thing is sure – I definitely know what love is not – it is not what you normally see in the movies.\nFor me, love is not a feeling – it is set of actions. It is a set of actions designed to convey to the other person that you care and that you are there. Think about this.\nLet’s now move on to relationships – relationships do not happen on their own, they are not made in heaven, they are not mandated by the HR departments in companies. Relationships are built over time and need care and attention to maintain. We are not born made for each other, we make each other into what we need each other to be.\nPay attention to the relationships around you. Recognize the basis of these relationships – it could be respect, a shared understanding, mutual admiration or whatever else it is. Work actively to preserve and strengthen the basis of these relationships. Grow in these relationships – feel enabled and empowered.\nWish you all the best – have fun, be happy and become successful.\nDisclaimer: I am not claiming any of this is original. Please relax about that. In these days of reading on the internet, it is becoming very difficult to keep track of one’s thoughts."

    "text": "What a wonderful book to introduce Ambedkar to children!  Having learnt about Gandhi till October 2nd, we wished to start learning about Dr. Ambedkar. This is among the books we will be using. Absolutely thrilled!\n\nHere is a quote from the postface, which is the more serious portion of the book.\n“The world is aware of Mahatma Gandhi’s train journey in South Africa where he was thrown out of a compartment despite possessing a first-class ticket. In comparison, even in India, far fewer people are aware of a similar, hugely significant train journey that Ambedkar undertook with his siblings while he was yet a child. If Gandhi’s famed train episode in South Africa exposed the racial bias of the colonisers, Babasaheb’s journey exposed the terrible evil of caste that has afflicted India for centuries. The colonisers have left but caste continues to afflict us like an incurable virus.\nThe parallels do not end there. Everyone knows of the Mahatma’s famed Dandi March undertaken in 1930 to protest the salt tax imposed by the British, but far fewer know of the peaceful march undertaken by Ambedkar three years prior to Gandhi’s march, in 1927. The long, non-violent march undertaken by thousands of Dalits, now known as the Mahad Satyagraha, was to the Chowdar Lake at Mahad, to protest against the ‘custom’ whereby Dalits were not permitted to use the waters of the lake! The salt tax was unfair and the world came to know about it, but if you stop to think about it, it was immeasurably worse to disallow Dalits from consuming water from a water source available to everyone else. As Dr Ambedkar himself famously said: ’Political tyranny is nothing compared to social tyranny, and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man that a politician who defies government.”\nRAJESH TALWAR\nPage 131"

    "text": "Home is where hot idly sambar is.\nNow, let me take a little bit of your time, and spread some light around the idea of sambar. Who knows where that might lead.\n Most of you may be aware of the triple point, which is the combination of temperature and pressure where a substance exists simultaneously in liquid, solid and gaseous states.\n(Don’t fret, my dear reader, this is still about sambar. It’s a science, you see!)\nThere is a triple point for sambar also. The triple point of sambar is where the salt, acid (tamarind) and heat (chilli) are balanced, and this entire balance is matched by the umami of the dal.\nIn fact, when you think about it, there are multiple triple points for sambar and the specific triple point at which you balance the sambar is what makes you love the cooking at your home the most. It is a matter of habit, there is no doubt, but the existence of multiple triple points is the reason for there being so many different “the best in the world” sambars, without any contradiction in terms.\nNow, that’s not all. There are broadly two categories of sambar, as any average connoisseur would tell you, viz. Sambar meant for idly, and sambar meant for rice. Let’s call them idly sambar and rice sambar henceforth.\nThe key point here, is that irrespective of your individual preference of triple point, there exists a cardinal rule that governs the relative positions of the balance of these sambars. Idly sambar shall be balanced at a higher level of salt acid heat, and with lesser dal in it, than the rice sambar. That’s it. You keep this in mind, and you are a master chef.\nPersonally, I prefer a relatively higher SAH balance in my rice sambar also, matched by a higher level of umami of the dal.\nAnd by the way, the discerning cook would have already homed in on the insight that all liquids like rasam, vatha kulambu, Mysore rasam, aracha sathumadu, pulusu, and even western things like soup and so on are all just a matter of finding different points to balance these four things at. I will close with just one or two examples – balance at a slightly lesser level of acid, using tomato or lemon, with a little ground up dal, and you have rasam. Take the acid high, using thick tamarind juice, balance with salt and heat, keeping the dal totally out, yes, there you have vatha kulambu.\nThus, we end having propounded a unified theory of sambar and allied products in the periodic table of food.\nWatch this space for a theory of everything food, in future instalments. I have the theory of salads in mind next, but if you would rather I talk about something else, put it in the comments and I shall do that one."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I read in the morning newspaper about Management Guru CK Prahlad passing away, I thought I would scour the internet in the hope of finding sufficiently amusing tributes…while one is not equipped intellectually to debate on the really relevant issues and one does not really know the luminary enough to feel any serious grief, one was confident that at least some of the people falling over themselves to write an important sounding tribute would provide the necessary entertainment.\nI needed not go farther than the 14th page in the hallowed newspaper. While I am not going to the extent of annotating the tribute with “reading notes”, I am going to the extent of ‘copy-pasting’ it for the fear that you will find navigating away from this page very difficult…captivating stuff here, no?\nA master abstractionist Lakshmi Narayanan\nIt was at a technology conference in 2004 that Carly Fiorina, then CEO of Hewlett-Packard, was delivering a keynote address. She was talking eloquently about HP’s experiment at Kuppam, Andhra Pradesh, where the company was empowering villagers through technology — distributing digital cameras and image printers that could be used to generate income. She called it “doing well by doing good” and went on to argue how the experiment had the potential to be a large revenue stream.\n(Extremely sorry to interrupt but this is an absolute must know fact: Kuppam was the constituency of the erstwhile hi-tech CM/CEO of AP – Mr. N. Chandrababu Naidu. In the world where railway ministers think nothing of ‘developing’ their own state, you can imagine the ‘developmental’ boost Kuppam would have got given Naidu was the CM for about 9 years – it’s these villagers that HP was ’empowering’ by distributing life-changing products like cameras and printers)\nProfessor C.K. Prahalad was also a speaker at the conference and Carly’s speech seemed to fit in with a hypothesis he was working on. His subsequent work on “Fortune at the bottom of the Pyramid” was a great abstraction of the many examples and stories that corporate leaders have experienced.\nOnce during a similar interaction with Professor Prahalad, I got an opportunity to talk about Cognizant and its growth story. I was elaborating on the company’s heritage, its image, its progress, its investment strategy and competitive pressures. It sounded almost like a big corporate pitch.\nProfessor Prahalad simply said: “You have to differentiate your firm along two or three key aspects and make sure that you make disproportionate investments along those areas.” This was such a simple abstraction of what we, as a firm, should be doing strategically, that even today all of our investments are evaluated to see if they make a big difference to how we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.\nThere are innumerable examples of his ability to abstract a theme in any given situation that can easily stand the test of time and any management theory. It is this ability that he put to use so effectively in defining a vision for India@75, as part of a large CII initiative. His prescription for a strong and resurgent India, simply put, is one of financial strength, technology excellence and moral authority. So simply put that his vision for India will live on.\nA management guru, a strategy consultant of the highest order and, above all, the Guru of Abstraction, Professor Prahalad will be missed by all in the corporate world. But his work will forever remain and guide leaders all over the world for a long time.\n(The writer is Vice-Chairman, Cognizant.)  Now, some useful reading.\n1. Romanticizing the Poor – Aneel Karnani\nMarket solutions to poverty are very much in vogue. These solutions, which include services and products targeting consumers at the “bottom of the pyramid,” portray poor people as creative entrepreneurs and discerning consumers. Yet this rosy view of poverty-stricken people is not only wrong, but also harmful. It allows corporations, governments, and nonprofits to deny this vulnerable population the protections it needs. Romanticizing the poor also hobbles realistic interventions for alleviating poverty.\n2. Will the Real Social Entrepreneur Please Stand Up?\nHow can you distinguish a business entrepreneur from a social entrepreneur? The answer is not as straightforward as it once was, says Abraham George, founder of The George Foundation, an NGO focused on poverty alleviation in southern India. Both are focused on profitability, margins and returns on investment. But social entrepreneurs go a step further, not only aiming to use their business activities to benefit society, but also involving society’s poorest members — now often referred to as the “Bottom of the Pyramid” — in efforts to reduce poverty and raise standards of living.\nThat’s all well and good, explains George in this opinion piece, but it is increasingly unclear who “the poorest of the poor” are. Definitions vary widely, which often means marketing strategies, growth plans and even products and services are not catering to the world’s poorest people. In the worst cases, even well-intentioned social entrepreneurs are misleading investors and the general public — and more importantly, letting down the billions of people living in poverty.\nAlright. I am off for a power nap. Profound thoughts, you know. Some Brain-tissue restoration is called for."

    "title": "Summary – Education and the significance of life – J Krishnamurti",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This book is about education, its significance to life and how education can help one find the significance of life. In this series of lectures, Krishnamurti explores and explains various aspects that influence education, and are influenced by education in turn.\nIn the initial chapters, Krishnamurti presents a case for urgently thinking about education and its significance for life. He talks about how the current approach to education is superficial and does not address deeper questions about life.\nIn the next few chapters, he dwells on the question of what the right kind of education is, asking the readers to question their ideas and explore their own thoughts. He states clearly that there is no one right method for providing the right kind of education. He lays out how the right kind of educators, parents and schools can bring about such an education of children.\nIn the later chapters, he speaks about sex, marriage, art and creativity, how we relate to these ideas and how our relationship with these ideas creates conflict in us. He emphasizes that an educator should have clarity regarding sex, marriage, art and creativity so that he can help the children see them for what they are and understand how to relate to them, without getting conflicted about or addicted to them.\n\n\n\nEducation and significance\n\n\nSummary of the key ideas\nCurrent education system:\nAll human beings seem to have similar nature – we want to find security and have a good time with as less effort as possible. We try to do this by earning more money, by becoming important persons and building other forms of security around ourselves. These achievements become important to us as these give us comfort. The urge to be successful along these lines creates a fear of not being able to attain these goals. Even after we reach these goals, protecting the comfort we get from them becomes very important, and we continue to be fearful. This fear makes us scared on new experiences and adventures. We are afraid to be different, to follow a course of action different from established societal norms. We confirm to authority and tradition.\nCurrent education system is built around the achievement of these goals. This system builds skills, emphasizes techniques, capacity and efficiency. We start to depend on these for our psychological security and that does not help. We continue to live fearfully, contributing to the misery and destruction in the world. Conventional education contributes to the conflicts we experience around us, within ourselves, with fellow humans and with nature. This cannot be right, as right kind of education should be free us of conflicts within, help us build relationships with other people, environment and society, should lead men and countries living peacefully with each other and universal peace.\nKrishnamurthy says that we are all disillusioned with the current education system, but we don’t know what to do, what to pursue, what kind of questions we need to ask and address to bring up our children. Systems cannot be blamed for our plight and we cannot expect miraculous changes in the current system. The individual is important, he should bring about a change in himself by understanding himself and the total process of self-awareness will bring in peace to the world.\nRight kind of education\nRight kind of education should help an individual be mature and free, to be affectionate and to love others, capable of dealing with life as a whole. Such an education should foster an understanding of ‘what is’ and help a person experience the integrated processes of life. When we face life and its experiences as they come, we develop an understanding of ourselves in relation to everything around us, keeping our intelligence highly awakened. Intelligence highly awakened is intuition, which is the only true guide in life.\nThe right kind of education should offer individual freedom, letting love and goodness bloom. It should help each individual student become aware of the conditioning influences around him and his own desires, that limit his mind and create fear. This will bring in thoughtfulness and consideration for others, without the promise of rewards or punishments. Otherwise, individuals get caught up in self-fulfillment, which causes conflicts and sorrows.\nThe right kind of education encourages the spirit of inquiry. We tend to stifle this spirit of inquiry as it leads to discontent and disturbs our sense of security but that is not right. Only when we encourage the children to question, will they be alert and develop keen insight. We should learn to think clearly and without bias, not to be influenced by authority or persuasion. The young should foster their discontent and keep the spirit of inquiry alive, not fall into the routine of job, security and permanency.\nUnderstanding of the entire process of one’s own consciousness is important to be an integrated human being. Only when we are aware of our conditioning and our responses, hopes and fears, there is a chance to go beyond the self. We need love and right thinking to bring about this revolution, within ourselves. Without love and right thinking, we will end up again in war and destruction. We will have peace only when we understand the causes of war, examine our attitudes towards our life and others. Right kind of education brings about this understanding.\nHow to bring about the right kind of education – What does not work\nNot through working towards an “ideal”: When we work for an ideal, we are working for ‘what should be’ completely neglecting the present ‘what is’. Our concern should be to help the individual understand himself. Once we are aware of what is, we should also not struggle with the awareness of what we are not. We should be interested fostering such an understanding in the child, rather than what to shape the child into.\nNot through “frameworks”, “systems” and “methods”: When we raise our children according to a framework and a system, we are actually training them to think in a particular way. Inculcating some values in children to make them conform to some ideals would be conditioning them. This does not allow them to grow into integrated individuals as they will not be able to think intelligently.\nWhen there is a method devised, even if it is done by a very thoughtful and intelligent person, there will be consideration for children only if they fit into it. The measurement of the child and his achievements start according to that method. This might be convenient for the educator, but it does not help in developing an integrated individual.\nNot through conditioning, discipline, fear or authority: Conditioning will not help people be happy or become intelligent. We are not interested in letting love and goodness flower if we are ourselves fearful showing apathy and no affection. We should take responsibility for spreading chaos and misery if we fail to bring in a radical change from the conditioning of the student. Whenever there is a revolt, the powerful become oppressive, either through persuasion or force.\nDiscipline has become one of the most important value in social structure. We practice various forms of discipline as it gives us more security and it gives good results. The ‘end result’ becomes more important than the means. However, the means determines the end. The danger of discipline is that system becomes more important than human beings. In that case, there is no love. Resistance and discipline do not give us the freedom. Freedom is not a goal which is to be achieved at the end. It is at the beginning.\nFear does not let intelligence thrive. Discipline may suppress fear but not remove it totally. Fear is instilled at school and at home in the hearts of the young. The adults around a child, the teacher and parents do not work on understanding the fears of the child. As we grow up, these fears guide our decisions and whole outlook of life. Fear cannot be the basis of right action. If the educator uses rewards and punishments, then he is breeding fear. If we do not make the ‘end result’ important, then we remove the fear of punishment, attraction of the rewards and any other compulsions.\nAuthority does not encourage understanding, it works in its ability to compel others to do what it wants done. There is no love in authority and compulsion, without love the individual does not relate to people, nature and society. There is no cooperation in relationship when there is authority.\nIf making the child obedient is the goal, then authority, discipline and compulsion may work. When we compel, the children obey just outwardly. Internally they become obstinate, impudent and adamant. Children become fearful and antagonistic. Discipline implies resistance. There is so much focus on the mind that we are failing to see the heart. Resistance and compulsion will not bring love and understanding.\nNot through “religious” education, rituals and beliefs: Religious education should foster relationship between individual and the environment. There is no existence without this relationship. When a parent and educator believe in this relationship, then their attitude and conduct convey the true meaning of spiritual life to the child. Rituals and beliefs, knowing them and following them is not true religion. A child should grow up without these encumbrances and only then will he truly inquire into the nature of reality of God.\nThe religion we see today does not foster individual freedom and integrity, it merely makes people follow some rituals. Religion in its true sense is a state of peace when there is self-knowledge and freedom. True religious education would be to help the child to be self-aware, read in depth and understand, and to determine the difference between the real and the temporary.\nNot through emphasis on nationalism, patriotism or the state: When the mind if free of ideologies and biases, it can actually see the truth. Beliefs, religions and ideologies are setting man against man, creating conflicts, not only between countries, but between societies and between people within the same society. If we identify ourselves with a country, when security is important, and we are conditioned by our dogmas, there will be strife and misery within us and in the world.\nPatriotism, while it is encouraged in schools and in the books, causes racial egotism by telling great stories about our country and our heroes who fought for our country and portrays our way of life better than others. This feeling feeds our excessive pride in belonging to this country and we feel we need to protect the country at any cost. We become ready to kill and be killed by someone. We should realize that human beings are more important than ideological boundaries.\nNationalism, like patriotism, makes people conscious of class and race and is separative in nature. Nationalism generates war, the spirit of nationalism comes from the aspiration to belong to a group greater than ourselves, to gain and to hold on to what we have gained. From this, springs the need to protect our sovereign States in the form of armed forces. Human life is undermined compared to properties and ideas. Parliaments and systems which uphold nationalism will never bring war to an end. Every separate group within a country, between countries is a source of war as they are guarding their sovereignty from external influences.\nThere is no hope for peace as long as education is managed by the state. The sovereign state does not want its citizens to think freely, it expects conformity, controls people through propaganda and distorted historical representations. Current education system is supporting the cause of the state by promoting ‘what to think’ instead of ‘how to think’. If we think differently from the prevailing systems, we become dangerous, free institutions might turn out people who think differently from the existing regime. These ideologies do not come from anywhere outside, it is our beliefs which are projected in those forms, and the government is what we are. We need to change fundamentally to bring in the right education and a peaceful world.\nHow to bring about the right kind of education – What may work\nIn the right kind of environment: What we (as parents and educators) think, say and do, matters and only that matters as it creates environment and environment can help or hinder a child. The school and home should not be contradictory to each other, so both parents and educators should reeducate themselves. The contradiction between the private life and life in a group creates endless conflicts in a person. This conflict is sustained through out in the wrong kind of education. We will not be able to give right kind of education unless we transform ourselves.\nWe must realize that learners are not merely conditioned by the environment. We are the environment. There are different entities in us revolving around ‘me’, the self. These several entities are our desires and from here the division between ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ starts. There is a gap between the ‘me’ and the environment. This is the beginning of inward and outward conflict. Self-knowledge is essential if one has to become free from the influences of the comfort of ‘self’.\nWith the right kind of thinking: We cannot achieve integration by conforming to current values. Even the recognition that we are confirming, brings about intellectual awareness but does not resolve the issue. Only when we become aware of what is causing the hindrance to our self-awareness and independent thinking, then we can be free from these influences. What we think matters, not what others want us to think. Without such an independent thinking, we will continue to conform and live in fear. The fears which are obvious and outward can still be identified and worked upon. The unconscious fears are the most difficult as we do not even know they exist. These fears guide our actions without our knowledge. We can be free of fear only with conscious effort. If we constantly keep watch over our thinking, we can bring some fears to the surface and build appropriate relationship with the environment.\nAs parents and teachers, it is our responsibility to think differently from the traditional beliefs. “A true educator is concerned with right living, right education and right means of livelihood”. Peace cannot be achieved by working superficially. It will result in one reform over other and then people divulge again into multiple ideologies. We need to understand things deeply, to stop the destruction caused by our own aggression and insecurities. Only then there is hope for our children and emancipation for the world.\nWith freedom and ‘intelligence’, not just ‘intellect’: Modern education brings in more and more theories and facts with little focus on understanding. This is intellect, but not intelligence which requires the integration of the mind and the heart in action. Intelligence comes with love. When thought functions independent of emotion, it is intellect, whereas intelligence is the ability to feel and reason. With only intellect and no intelligence, we will lead our society to chaos and destruction.\nThere should be a spirit of freedom and intelligence in a child’s studies. The students should be encouraged to ask questions rather than accept readymade formulas and conclusions. Teachers can provide guidance when they are free from dominance and help the children towards creative understanding and freedom, and not driving the child towards a goal. The student should be able to find out what he is interested in through right kind of education. A true teacher does not bind himself to any ideology or belief or country. He is free from the compulsion of society or any government. An educator is the foundation for true culture.\nIn the right kind of schools: A school which is successful in a worldly sense is a failure as an educational center. A large building consisting of so many hundreds of children will be churning our clerks and salesmen, industrialists, people who are technically efficient. The hope of integrated individual can only be achieved only when there is attention available to each individual in school. There should be a small school with limited number of boys and girls and right kind of educators.\nThe teachers and children should meet on a regular basis to discuss all the matters relating to the whole group and its well-being. A student council should be formed along with some teachers to address issues of discipline, cleanliness, food and so on. Self-government in school should be encouraged, for when they come out of school they are ready for self-government outside too. If a child learns to be dispassionate, intelligent and considerate in discussions, he will be able to face complexities of life efficiently. The school should encourage children to know each other’s challenges, difficulties and peculiarities.\nThrough the right kind of educators: The right kind of education begins with the educator. If the educator is not free from his own patterns of thought, he cannot teach that to children. As educators, we need to educate ourselves rightly. We should be concerned with our own education first than to worry about future wellbeing and security of the child.\nBeing a teacher is not a profession, but a way of life for a true teacher. One should teach only if they have the passion to teach. For the right educator, teaching is not self-fulfilling, but self-renunciation.\nA teacher should understand what ‘teaching’ is according to him. A teacher must be constantly alert and aware of his own thoughts and feelings. A teacher must understand what intelligence is to awaken intelligence in a child. If the teacher is not free, then we cannot help the child to relate to others and the environment and work on their fears, unhappiness and frustrations.\nA teacher must have interest in working in the school, they should come voluntarily. If the teachers have to help each other and help students to understand the right values, there must be constant and alert awareness in their daily relationship. Each teacher should feel responsible. There is no need for a central authority if everyone is responsible and regulate themselves. When there is a feeling of equality among all the teachers, then there is no place for fear of others and all misunderstandings can be resolved through discussions. This is essential in the right kind of school.\nEach teacher is entitled to leisure time and everyone should facilitate that in the school. Only then will the teachers have the motivation and energy to spend with children and build direct relationship with them. Each child requires patience, alertness and intelligence to study. The right kind of educator should have the skill, immense interest and a sense of affection to be able to cater to individual needs of every child.\nWith collaboration between parents and teachers: People undergo rigorous training to become engineers, lawyers and doctors but for becoming parents there is no training, even though it’s a very important task. Many parents shift the responsibility of the wellbeing of the child to the school, it becomes the responsibility of the educator to educate the parents as well. The educator should explain the difficulties, aptitudes and the child’s temperament to the parents and make them understand what he is trying to do for their child. Right education is a shared task between parents and teachers which demands patience, consideration and affection.\nIf parents love their children, they will not be nationalistic, they will not support a State which brings war, and kills their children. They will discover how to relate to property and understand how false importance to property destroys the world. They will not belong to any organized religion as it creates rifts between men, they will leave envy and conflict and work on changing the structure of present day society. They make sure they get the education that will help them be sensitive, intelligent and integrated.\nWith understanding and love: Through careful study and understanding of difficulties, tendencies and capacities of each child, we can help him to be integrated and intelligent.\nDeep understanding and insight are necessary to educate a child. We need to constantly observe a child to understand him. We should not burden the child with our values and idiosyncrasies and act as owners and dominate them. If we regard our children as continuation of ourselves and expect them to fulfill our ambitions, then we will be building an environment without love, the children will get into pursuing self-centeredness.\nRole of sex, marriage, art and creativity\nWe strive to find ways to lose our ‘self’ and achieve a state of happiness. Creativity gives most of us that satisfaction. When we do everyday tasks, we feel it only through the brain, and repeat mechanically. If we are not creative, the only other means of creativeness, to help lose oneself, is sex. We lead busy lives, running from one end to the other, without experiencing moments of creativity. Sex becomes the only outlet, an experience we seek again and again.\nSex in itself is not a problem but the desire to capture the state of happiness again and again is. Securing this happiness becomes an important goal. Fear sets in and makes us conform to authority and hinders creative living. Only by examining our hearts and mind, we will be able to find out our desires. If we are thoughtful and affectionate, desire does not dominate the mind. Sensation becomes all-consuming when there is no love.\nWhen we are young, we deal with our sexual urges by disciplining and controlling, fearful of becoming lustful. Organized religions concern themselves about our sex lives, but not equally violent things like patriotism, envy, ruthlessness, hunger for power and success. This is because they depend on our hopes and fears for their very existence.\nThe institution of marriage cannot provide answers to the issues of sex, if there is no understanding of the process of desire. Love is not of the mind, it is independent of thought, demands and reactions. When there is love, sex is never a problem. The hindrances of the mind are the problem, therefore it’s important to understand the process of the mind.\nIf the parents and the teachers are themselves caught in this maze, they will not be able to help the child develop their heart and the mind. What we are today is the result of series of influences and accidents, and each of us have to understand the confusion of our own nature.\nIn the pursuit of losing the self, people take to art, drink, follow religious doctrines. When we try to do things to escape ourselves, we become addicted to them. The right kind of education should help the individual to face his problems rather than look for escape, eliminate conflict and then the individual can see his way to being creative.\nArt which is not integrated with life has no importance. If art is separate from our daily life, it becomes removed, artificial. It becomes just a superficial desire to express ourselves and to escape from what is. Art should be integral part of our lives, we should strive to bridge the gap between our life and the technical knowledge we have acquired.\nWe should be aware of the emptiness in our hearts and mind, and hold ourselves away from other sensations and stimulations, keep ourselves open and be sensitive, then there can be creation and we find the joy of creativity. We might think that if we learn a technique, we can be secure and happy. But creative happiness comes only when our inner self is rich, and it is not attained through any system. Self-improvement is another way of securing ‘me’ and ‘mine’, is not creative, it is not even love of beauty. When there is constant awareness of the mind, and the hindrances it has, creativeness comes into being.\nOne can be creative without any talent. Creativeness is a state of mind where there are no conflicts and sorrows, no desires. In this state, truth comes into being. There is not sensation of self. The mind does not seek anything. In this state, there is creation.\nWe will be able to develop sensitivity in the young only when we are sensitive to beauty and to ugliness. We will be alert and be able to see things only when we are quiet. We should work to awaken the joy of seeing in a child, seeing what man has created and also the beauty of nature."

    "text": "​Here are a couple of ideas that have helped me stay logically correct and keep my friendships longer.\nSometimes, people we think of as friends do things that greatly upset us. More often than not, we are hurt and start thinking of the said friend’s intentions. Given enough time, we end up questioning our judgements about the friend, his/her overall character and tend to reevaluate his/her past behaviour through a more negative lense. Very soon, we are no longer friends and sorry about the fact that we are no longer friends.\nSometimes, WE do things that greatly upset our friends. When we become aware of the fact that the friend is upset, we set out to explain – “please understand WHY I did this”. The friend asks – “why would YOU do something like this?”\nNote the difference in focus – we find it is easier to take into account the impact of situations, circumstances and external factors when explaining our behaviour but find it difficult to account for these factors to explain the other person’s behaviour. This is a cognitive bias called “fundamental attribution error”, also known as the correspondence bias or attribution effect. This bias, as defined on Wikipedia, is the tendency of people to place undue emphasis on the character or intentions of people, rather than external factors when explaining another person’s behaviour in a given situation. This contrasts with interpretating one’s own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can be taken into account.\nWhen we recognise that it is common for us to blame character or intention for other’s actions and ignore situational factors, it becomes that much more easy to stop the negative cycle of questions, be more open, have a conversation, and clear up things.\nHanlon’s razor is a less tedious and more fun way of saying nearly the same as the above. A version of it goes – “Never assume malice when stupidity will suffice”, or “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness”.\nBoth of these ideas help us broaden our focus when we are dealing with people and allow us to take more factors into account to explain or enquire about their behaviour. With the right mindset and the right set of questions, we can understand each other more and remain friends much longer."

Farm Hill is an inclusive, neurodiverse a community of teachers, parents and students learning together in a close to nature setting – a 4.5-acre piece of land about 65 km from Bangalore, on the Chennai highway near Shoolagiri, acquired with generous support from many friends.\n  [![img_20181024_094555681](https://i0.wp.com/venugvgk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_20181024_094555681.jpg?w=527&h=702&ssl=1 \"img_20181024_094555681\")](https://venugvgk.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/farm-hill-learning-requesting-support/img_20181024_094555681/)        [![img_20181024_095318023](https://i0.wp.com/venugvgk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_20181024_095318023.jpg?w=465&h=349&ssl=1 \"img_20181024_095318023\")](https://venugvgk.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/farm-hill-learning-requesting-support/img_20181024_095318023/)     [![img_20190101_075604716](https://i0.wp.com/venugvgk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_20190101_075604716.jpg?w=465&h=349&ssl=1 \"img_20190101_075604716\")](https://venugvgk.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/farm-hill-learning-requesting-support/img_20190101_075604716/)        Why Farm Hill?\nMany of us would agree that the way we educate our children needs a serious overhaul. There needs to be many alternatives to the monocultural way we are currently educating them. There are a few alternative schools that have been running successfully but we need many more. Farm Hill intends to provide one such alternative.\nThe other thread running through Farm Hill is the need for us to work with people who are different from the most of us. When we say ‘every child is different’, many of us do not seem to be extending the definition of ‘different’ to include children whose neurologies are different. Farm Hill intends to address this by including children on the autism spectrum in our student population.\nOver a period of time, we have found that the way one educates an autistic child is no different from the way one educates a neurotypical child; it is just that the current school system is suitable for neither. We intend to work with both neurotypical and autistic children in a setting that takes care of the unique needs of each child.\nWe need support.\nLike we mentioned, we have already acquired the land. We intend to start by the mid-2019. We need support for the first set of buildings – one living space for about 20 people, one kitchen and a multi-purpose hall. We also need a 20- seater bus.\nTotal funding requirement would be around 60 lakhs – approximately, 45 for buildings and 15 for the bus.\nWe are setup as a trust. Donations would be tax-exempt.\nWe hope this is informative enough. Please get in touch if you are interested in being a part of our journey or to just say Hi. You can write to me on venu.gvgk@gmail.com or call me on 7760769323.\nThank you!\nDetails of our work:\n\nQuick Summary of our work – We have a child on the autism spectrum; we home schooled him till the time he was 10. We have also been running Sambhavam Center for Autism for about 4 years. Currently, we work with about 40 children in our center.\nOur journey as autism parents (2009 – 14) https://pingnama.wordpress.com/2014/03/15/parents-choice/\nOur work at Sambhavam – https://medium.com/staff-you-trust/a-spectrum-of-possibilities-1223888c0775"

    "text": "What kind of language do we use to talk about people who are usually referred to as ‘special needs’ or ‘differently-abled’? There is a huge debate, usually framed in terms of ‘person first language’ or ‘identify first language’. How to look at the question and the debate surrounding it? What is a sensible position to take? My thoughts below.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent not less\n\n\nIs language important? Yes. Are labels important? Yes. From various points of view – clinical, representational etc. – labels and language are important. The question we are grappling with is, what is the kind of language we use for the labels?\nFirst off, not withstanding whatever else I say further on, I am fully with the idea that the people who are being labelled and the people who know them best should have the freedom to make these calls. Also, agree that these calls may change from setting to setting. And whatever my thinking is, I will respect the decisions made by them.\nHaving said that, in the absence of a preference indicated by someone (because the moment they indicate a preference, I just fall in line, no need to think further), or in a public forum where I might be addressing different people with a variety of preferences, how do I take this call? Once I or somebody takes a call to use a certain kind of language, how should the others react?\nLets get the obvious out of the way first. I guess we agree that words like ‘handicapped’, ‘వికలాంగులు’, ‘divyanga’ are not necessarily more respectful or sensitive. These are arbitrary labels that do not perform any of the functions of the language and labels we outline above.\nLet’s then take two steps back and look at some common adjectives used to describe people: short – tall, fat – thin, dark – fair etc. Why is ‘shorty’ or ‘fatso’ a negative word while ‘tallly’ or ‘thinso’ is not? Is it because of the word, or is it because of the negative value that we as a society attach to being short or being fat?\nImagine, tomorrow the sky turns into a solid roof and comes down to five foot high from the ground. All the tall people will have to go around with their backs bent. Do we think ‘shorty’ would be a negative word then? In the land of the blind, would a one eyed man be king or be an outcast, isolated for his freakish behavior?\nWe can also look at more ‘real’ examples. Take the case of the dalits. There was a time when calling someone a ‘dalit’ was an insult. Today, we have people proudly adding words like ‘mala’ and ‘madiga’ to their names. Did this self respect and confidence come because the society called them ‘harijans’? I would think that the self respect came when they started proudly proclaiming their identities, no longer believing that the identity is a disadvantage.\nIn short, the society (which is you, me and us, no need to externalize and demonize it) steps carefully around identities which it believes to be at a disadvantage. The ginger-ness does not necessarily relieve the perceived disadvantage. When “the labelled” are comfortable with themselves and the society is by-and-large okay with them, the label really does not matter.\nSo, if we really believe the differences are just differences and nothing more and nothing less, we should just be clear in our language. There is no need to be extra-cautious.\nSo, subject to the caveats described in the second paragraph above, I would rather say ‘autistic child’ and not unnecessarily complicate the language.\nAt this point I am also informed by some of the opinions expressed by autistic adults. In fact, a survey (Reference at the end) found that “the term ‘autistic’ was endorsed by a large percentage of autistic adults, family members/friends and parents but by considerably fewer professionals”. The survey also concluded “These findings demonstrate that there is no single way of describing autism that is universally accepted and preferred by the UK’s autism community and that some disagreements appear deeply entrenched.”\nNow to the other question – Once I or somebody takes a call to use a certain kind of language, how should the others react? Do not assume disrespect or any other negative emotion. As discussed above, the choice of language is a complicated one to make and there may not be a single correct way of making that choice. Recognise that there is no “right” way of making that choice. If you are being addressed a certain way and you have a different preference, let it be known politely and expect the other person to respect your choice. Do not assume malice where an assumption of ignorance is sufficient. Or there might genuinely be scope for a different point of view.\nPS: As I think about it, I would be much less comfortable saying someone is ‘blind’ and would rather say ‘visually impaired’. Why this different standard? Is it because I am much less familiar with blindness, compared to autism? Or am I making an as-yet-unexamined assumption about blindness?\nHow does this then work with people whose exposure to ‘different’ populations is limited?\nReferences:\nLorcan, K., Hattersley, C. Molins, B. Et al. Which terms should be used to describe autism? Perspectives from the UK autism community: Autism, Vol 20, Issue 4, pp. 442 – 462, First Published July 1, 2015"

All of us need an ostensibly oppressive system to rebel against. Being in charge of one’s own destiny, if you think about it, is very inconvenient.”\nBhakta, thanks to what is now quite some years of practice, managed to ignore the lurking suspicion that there was a lesson intended for him in Baba’s reply."

Naturally, most of the Bhakta’s were having significant difficulties with this apparent ‘counter-intuitive’ line of thought.\nSenior Bhakta, in the warm glow of post-discussion resonance, was holding forth: “Life is anyway such a gamble and so full of uncertainity…” and so on.\nJunior Baba interjected: “Life is more like a game of chess”\nSr. Bhakta, momentarily taken aback, looked thoughtful, shook his head a couple of times, apparantly at the dawn of a new understanding, and tried a comeback: “yeah, I see what you mean…there is definitely an element of skill and thought…”.\nVery uncharacteristically for a Baba, Jr. Baba cut in again and explained: “When you gamble, you typically trust in chance and you know that it could go either way. When you lose, you can blame your luck. At any point of time, you know how far ahead or behind you are. Technically, you can choose to stop playing anytime. Hopefully, you quit while you are ahead of the game.\nNow, think of a game of chess. You start the game thinking that you have the skill to win. You think long and hard building the foundations for a win. You invest effort, hope and all for some time. Then the setbacks start, with a significant lag, allowing you enough time to kick yourself for all the mistakes you have been making. There is no going back and there is no knowing whether you are winning or losing. By the time you realise you are definitely losing, it’s usually too late to do anything about it”\nBhaktas were so engrossed in this vision that there was no comment when Jr. Baba added softly, as if to himself: “And eventually, lose you shall, however inconceivable it looks right now”."

I picked it up not because I knew anything about it but because I was looking for a Bengali novel in English and it was visibly available.\nI read the book on the flight back…and I finished it later. It’s a complex tale of various characters and emotions set in a hotel, told through the eyes of a hotel clerk. While I enjoyed the book and would say it’s good, I would not attempt a review. It’s a complex book, as I already said, and I had read it only once. A braver soul reviewed the book in Hindu in 2007 here.\nI had read somewhere that this book is generally compared to Arthur Hailey’s The Hotel. I haven’t read The Hotel, so can’t say any thing more on that. As an aside, while Hailey fans talk about Money Changers and Airport, I personally think his Detective is a very good piece of crime fiction.\nAny way, chowringhee was written in 1962 and was translated in to English in 2007. It has been nominated for The Independent Foreign Fiction Prize for 2010 – the first time that an Indian work has accomplished the feat. “Results“ are expected on May 13th. What struck me most was this line from the article in The Hindu :\nAsked why the English translation came more than 40 years after it was first written, the author candidly remarked, “I suppose it was my middle class Bengali arrogance — why should I take my work to the world, the world should come to me.”\nI love straight talk, especially the self-deprecating kind. I also love it when one of the books I have read and appreciated gets recognized. For your information, I had read Slumdog Millionaire in its original avatar as ‘Q&A’…I am a discerning reader, you know! By the way, Vikas Swarup’s next book, The Six Suspects, plain sucks!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Anyone who has ever thought of doing something different, useful or personally fulfilling, knows how difficult it is to step out of the dominant thought patterns of self, family and the society around.\nThe first lesson I sought from Subba was how he was able to do it, with apparent ease.\n\n\n\nSubba at Timbaktu 2007\n\n\nSubba at Timbaktu 2007\nAt the time I met him in 2006, Subba was the head of Timbaktu School, living, learning and working with about 60 underprivileged children, living on a salary of not more than a few thousand rupees a month. While everyone called him ‘subba’ or ‘subbanna’, he was actually Dr. U. Subba Raju, alumnus of APRS Kodigenahalli, APRJC Nagarjuna Sagar, IIT Madras (B. Tech) and IIT Bombay (M. Tech and Ph.D.). I was curious as to how he was able to leave so many opportunities behind and come do the work he was doing.\nWhat made me ask the question more insistently, was the fact that he came from a very poor background and was a family man – he had two girls.\n\n\n\nSubba and Family 2015\n\n\nSubba and Family 2015\nTill that time, the ‘social entrepreneurs’ (how I hate the word!) I met were people who had secure backgrounds, who did not need to worry about their pasts or their children’s future; or were youngsters who hadn’t really started experiencing the repercussions of their youthful decisions. Here was a person who had grown up selling Idlis in Tirupati bus stand during the bad times the family experienced, who went on to acquire the most ‘secure’ credentials one could hope for in India, and then left everything behind and is sitting in this middle of nowhere school, teaching children from difficult backgrounds.\nMy question was as much personal and as it was professional. While I did not experience the kind of deprivation Subba did, and would not even be able to imagine it, I too grew up in difficult economic circumstances, living in a small-town slum as a child. I got a decent education thanks to Navodaya Vidyalayas and was at the brink of securing useful ‘credentials’ with my MBA at the IIM Bangalore. Even though I had not yet experienced corporate life, I was already thinking of stepping out, and I had a family and a child. To me, Subba was my personal beacon, and I wanted to understand how he did what he did. No question that what he was doing was noble, but I wanted to go beyond the usual explanations of noble thoughts being the drivers of noble deeds. I was looking for how to deal with the practical, while living the high-minded life.\nI had two specific questions for him. One, how was he able to deal with the pressure of his obligations to his parents and siblings – both in the form of his own feeling of duty to them, and in the form of their expectations from him. Two, how is he able to deal with the idea of depriving his children from getting the benefit of the advantages he secured with his hard work. By this time, I felt I had known him enough to see that he did not need to deal with conflicts coming from his own self.\nHis answers were simple yet profound. He answered the second question first, and clearly, saying that all that his parents could give him was an opportunity to get a good education, and he has been able to make use of it. He felt that he was in a position to offer a similar advantage, that of a good education, to his children, and he believed that they will be able to do at least as well as he himself did. This answer made sense to me.\nHe answered the question about his biological family, saying that for quite some time, his family did not really figure how big a deal his education was, and by the time they got to understand, he was already well on his way out of that kind of life, and was able to step out of the expectations, obligations cycle. This answer was a little less satisfactory to me at that time. Years later, after he passed away, during a conversation with one of his family members, it struck me that his mother, who he cared about deeply, passed away in the year he graduated out of his Ph.D. Then, it kind of made sense.\nOver the next four years, I completed my studies and started working, but kept in touch with Subba and Timbaktu. Every year, my wife Chithra, our son and I would visit Timbaktu, the same way we would visit our parents. We got to know Subba and his family, and his work, more and more. Both Chithra and I were interested in his thinking about alternatives to mainstream education. We would spend a lot of time discussing things, interacting with children, walking around, generally having a good time. The seeds of our thinking about education were sown then, and we nurtured it through our yearly visits.\nAll this while, we were thinking of doing something different, going off the usual path, but kept doing what we were doing. Our son was going to be 3, when we decided we will not send him to regular school. We were looking for options when we discovered that he was on the autism spectrum. We had always noticed he was different from other children, but it became clear that it was clinical and that he was suffering because of the limitations of being autistic.\nIt was a stressful time as we figured what autism was and what would be good for the child. It was clear that we needed to do something different. Both of us left our lives and relocated to Bangalore, to access therapies for the child. Everyone we knew, this included some of the brightest minds we have been fortunate to know, advised us against the move. The most important factor that drove us to do what we thought was right, was the fact that we knew Subba, we knew he did what he did and did it well. We knew the world out there was not as bad as everyone thought. We knew we would survive.\nWhen we relocated to Bangalore, we had come closer to Subba. We kept meeting more frequently and he was a great source of strength while we made various decisions about our future as individuals and as a family. He was there to help us home-school the child, he was there thinking along with us as we set up Sambhavam, a therapy centre for autism. He was there observing the therapists do their work and would discuss behavior analysis with Chithra.\n\n\n\nSubba, Venu and Chithra\n\n\nSubba, Venu and Chithra\nHe was there as we vaguely discussed the idea of Farm Hill, an alternative, neurodiverse learning space. He would happily contribute his dreams, and we planned we would do it together. All this, while he was dealing with his own life, his exit from Timbaktu, his wife’s illness, his children’s education, his work with a children’s magazine, and later as a wandering teacher working with various mainstream schools. We had the good fortune of spending a lot of time with him, and glad that we told him, in so many words, what difference he has made and continued to make, to our lives. He was there on our son’s birthday, with two bags full of fruits and vegetables from his garden. He was there, along with his family, at our home one day, as I left for Trichy. They travelled back home that night.\nThen, the next day morning, he had a stroke and was on his way to Bangalore. I rushed back to Bangalore, just in time to receive him at the hospital. He held on to my hand as he was carried out of the vehicle, with a vague smile on his lips. A week later, he was no more.\nIt’s been three years and not a day passes by without us referring to or thinking of something that Subba used to say or do, as we continue to homeschool our child and work at Sambhavam and Farm Hill. We will soon have 200 trees here, as he dreamt of. Subba still is our personal beacon.\n  [![IMG-20160815-WA0008](https://i0.wp.com/venugvgk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img-20160815-wa0008.jpg?w=496&h=661&ssl=1 \"IMG-20160815-WA0008\")](https://venugvgk.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/subba/img-20160815-wa0008/)        [![IMG-20160815-WA0010](https://i0.wp.com/venugvgk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img-20160815-wa0010.jpg?w=496&h=661&ssl=1 \"IMG-20160815-WA0010\")](https://venugvgk.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/subba/img-20160815-wa0010/)        We had always heard of Subba’s friends – he kept in touch with people, he would enthusiastically tell stories of friends – but we did not really meet many of them, because we would all meet Subba individually when he was free, greedily looking for his time and attention. Once he passed away, we have met many of them, and we see that Subba impacted almost each of them, as profoundly as he impacted us. He was a part of many lives and he will continue to be a part of many lives, of friends, colleagues and students."

    "text": "We were in Timbaktu a couple of weeks back. This time, we went there on the new bike. 165 kilometers. Three of us. The road was very good, it’s a 4 lane highway now and the bike handled very well. We had fun going there.\nMy brother Phani came there from Hyderabad. It was his first time at the place. One morning, I decided to take him up the hill to the temple for a morning walk. We started at 7.15 am for what was supposed to be a 45 minute walk before breakfast at 8. Now, Phani is the kind that makes a picture documentary out of every thing. This post is about the walk. There are lots of pictures, mostly by Phani, and a little story. You are warned now.\nThis was the starting point. \nWe started walking in a little while and passed by the school gate which is also the point where Timbaktu ends.\n\nNow, Phani has this penchant for taking photos right next to all sorts of boards. It does help once in a while, like the time they went to Sabarimalai on a 10 day trip through completely unfamiliar country. After coming back home, it was only with the help of his ‘board photos’ that they could actually figure out what they had seen. Anyway, here is his photo at ‘Timbaktu 0 km’.\n\nOnce we got out of the place, this was the path we took to go up the hill.\n\nAround four years back, when we went to the place for the first time, there was a small old temple on the hill. And there were stories of a Baba who used to live there sometime back. These days, the whole place has become a temple complex. There are lots of people now and as usual, a large pile of trash right next to the water course that runs down. Lets pass up the gory pictures. There is also a well, yes, on the top of the hill. It is never dry. These days it is gated and closed. In spite of that, there were small polythene covers in which devotees have left fruits, flowers and incense sticks afloat on the water. As an offering. Here is a picture of the gate and a small old temple.\n\n\nOnce we reached the well, we were supposed to turn back. But then, I remembered that the last time there was a field of wild Basil on the hill side above and I wanted to check it out. So we proceeded up the hill from there. Rather predictably, there was no wild Basil. As we were about to turn around, we came across this sight.\n\nAnd, there was the water course that ran right along side the path. The same water course runs all the way down the hill, flowing next to Timbaktu and eventually crossing the highway. I wanted to see where it came from. We found a nice place almost exactly at the point the path in the picture is disappearing. Its actually taking a turn to the left there and the water course crosses the path there. Here is the nice secluded spot we found.\n\nThe rocks were quite cool to touch, the sand was the coarse grainy type that makes sitting on it very pleasant. The small patch of sand could sit about 4 -5 people. Naturally, we found a couple of bottles (Rs. 89 for 375 ml) of cheap liquor. This is the only place in the stream to have those black rocks strewn about. And the place is nicely shielded from the path by the thick bush.\nWhen we got back on the path, we found it stretching forward on level ground and then dipping down. I thought we could walk till the point where it starts going down and turn back. So we walked along the path.\n\nWe trudged on till the end of this level ground and this was the point where the path started going down the hill.\n\nThere was a lone hill ahead to the left. The path looked well used. Through the mist in the distance, we could hear vehicles on the highway and generally knew that the highway was in that direction, about 5 – 6 km away. We decided to go on in the hope of finding a hamlet or reaching the highway and walking back to Timbaktu from that side.\nBy this time, the sun was shining brightly and the sky was an awesome blue color. Here is a picture of the hill on our right.\n\nWe walked for about another kilometer. The highway was still within hearing distance but didn’t look like we were getting any nearer to it. We reckoned we have at least a 10 – 12 kilometer trek back if we went on to the highway. From the point we were in, we needed to traverse 2.75 sides of a near square. The sun was getting hot and we didn’t even have any water with us. Then we found this dip in the cliff to our left that looked like a pass. We started thinking of a shortcut back through the hills. We were still reluctant to go back the way we came. It looked too easy.\n\nHere is a photo of yours truly, traversing the pass. Leading from the front has its own advantages 🙂\n\nHere is a picture of the scene on the other side as we saw it. It did not look familiar at all. We were hoping for a path going left or straight that would take us back towards Timbaktu. The only path ahead led firmly to the right, towards the highway. We went along ahead.\n\nWe thought the path to Timbaktu lay beyond the low cliff seen in the distance. But then, we were also sure that the stream we tracked for sometime lay somewhere between us and Timbaktu. And it ran through a deep depression which would take quite some effort to cross even if we reach this side of it. As we walked on debating it, we found some people working on the fields. We asked them for directions.\nThey said there is no path ahead and they themselves come the same way we did in to that clearing. They firmly advised us to go back. I still think they dissuaded us looking at our obvious city faces and shorts and shoes, but then, we turned back. And again, the pass we came from looked very inviting.\n\nBy this time we were about an hour and three quarters in to the walk. We walked back to timbaktu in about an hour and half. When we finally reached the place, we were very glad for double portions of the wheat rava upma Subba had saved for us."

That’s why most of our love is attachment and jealousy.\nNow the key point he makes is that unless thought itself, meaning every person’s own thinking itself, starts to see this, repeat, start to see this by itself, without any external imposition of this idea, there is no freedom.\nUnless your thinking itself sees this, this very idea becomes another thought created by thinking and imposed upon your mind. That leads to conflict.\nA couple of thoughts (now, it’s difficult to not smile when using this word in this context here. ):\nReading some of these notes, I see how extraordinarily difficult it is for this to happen. Once I have heard this idea, how difficult it is to not accept it as another dictum, and to start independently and seek it for myself! How difficult not to think that I have now had this realization and feel the pleasure of that enlightenment! This is like trying to forget what one knows. It’s like how a child who has already read about and has seen pictures of pollination struggles to actually observe the process. But all analogies fail, naturally.\nAlso, how extraordinarily difficult it is to convey any of this..The very language becomes a hindrance. The words just fail sometimes."

The other day, he came to farm hill along with a group, singing Christmas carols. Srikar got inspired and sang ‘silent night’. And got invited to sing in the church.\nSo this morning we went and the lad belted out ‘three kings in the orient’, ‘deck the halls’ and ‘silent night’, closing with ‘jingle bells’. The songs were well received.\n In the prayer that followed, the congregation started singing a Tamil song which broadly meant, ‘O God that resides in all of us, please lead me to salvation’. The pastor chose to share words that broadly paraphrased Mathew 16:24: Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.”\nAnd that reminded me of Bhagavadgita 18:66 सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज | अहं त्वां सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच: || (Abandon all varieties of dharmas and simply surrender unto Me alone.

So, if I don’t have any of these I am the only person responsible…Now, if these are to be found within you, how can I ‘give’ them to you? I know from the little experience I have that it is impossible to ‘give’ peace of mind to someone. That someone has to find his own peace of mind.\nThis way, I am responsible for my unhappiness and that is also because I have not given happiness to you. How sensible is that?” And so on…\nWhen he was sufficiently calmed down, IIMbaba asked gently, “Bhakta, is it just possible that there is no real meaning attached to either of the two points of view ?”\nWhen Bhakta was suitably startled and started to pay attention, he continued, “don’t you think there is something suspicious about the way life is made to sound like a quest, a means to some end? Critically examine the value you attach to concepts like freedom and happiness. Where does this value come from? Is it not some form of conditioning? Now, knowing your elders, your contemporaries and yourself like you do, is it just possible that we all have got it completely wrong?”\nBhakta nodded sagely and the discussion continued.\nHe was later overheard, sounding very pleased, saying: “it is a good approach. When the solutions or the lack of any baffles you, you should look at redefining the problem. I guess that’s what they teach you at the Babaschool also”"

    "text": "This is especially for people who like to interact with others, on Facebook and elsewhere. Awareness and understanding of this hierarchy (and obviously, the willingness to use it) will help you, whether you are a writer or a reader. It will likely increase the quality of conversations and make people having them happier – as outlined by Graham in his 2008 essay How to Disagree.\nI think it is important because the predominant mind set of the ‘interactions’ these days seems to be – ‘I have an opinion and however uninformed it might be, I am going to defend it with my life and honor’. Anything that changes this is indeed likely to increase the overall well being of people.\nThe following is a pictorial representation of the disagreement hierarchy. The hierarchy describes levels of disagreement DH0 to DH6 starting from the bottom.\n\n\n\nGraham’s_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg (1)\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia, By ‘Loudacris’.\nRead the original essay for a more detailed explanation. Paul Graham says the following about why it is important to classify and label forms of disagreement.\nIt helps the readers\n“The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it will help people to evaluate what they read. In particular, it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments. An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing an opponent merely by using forceful words. In fact that is probably the defining quality of a demagogue. By giving names to the different forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping such balloons.”\nIt helps the people who are writing\n“Such labels may help writers too. Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional. Someone arguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he’s really saying something. Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.”\nSuch an awareness will decrease the need to be mean and make people happier\n“But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier. If you study conversations, you find there is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6. You don’t have to be mean when you have a real point to make. In fact, you don’t want to. If you have something real to say, being mean just gets in the way.\nIf moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of them happier. Most people don’t really enjoy being mean; they do it because they can’t help it.”\nHappy conversations!!\nPS: I have some immediate evidence in support of “you don’t have to be mean when you have a real point to make”. My original first paragraph (which I am now reproducing from memory as I had deleted it) was:\nThis is especially for people who like to interact with others, on Facebook and elsewhere. Note that I am saying ‘interact’ and not ‘argue’ or ‘discuss’ because at least in my mind, an argument has some logic to it and a discussion has some sanity, some scope for nuance, and some space for disagreement. The predominant mindset behind ‘interactions’ today seems to be ’I have an opinion and however uninformed it is, I will defend it with my life and honor.\nAs you can see, the current paragraph is much less meaner than this and that is because after the first draft, I think I realized that the sarcasm may not really help much to get the point across to the demographic that needs it most. Or I have a strong confirmation bias. Whatever."

As you go and grow, you will come across people and situations where your idealism and your urge to do good seems to be a disadvantage.\nA point comes where you are overwhelmed by the number of times this is happening. You start thinking about snatching the advantage back. You start questioning the practicability of your ideals.\nThat point is the real test of your fortitude, your commitment to what you really want to do. The easy path is to turn into everyone else.\nThat path will eventually lead to failure. Have no doubt about that. You may ‘succeed’ but that ‘success’ will not be at what you really wanted to do. It would be a completely different goal, even when you score it.\nThat is the time to think hard and look close. Choose the people and situations you work with. Grow slowly. Focus on building a community of like-minded people. You will notice the ‘overwhelming number of times’ go down to manageable levels. With any luck, they will eventually disappear.\nWhile all of this happens, hang in. Take care of yourself and your well-wishers. At the same time, be ready to let go.

He will then become one of us. No, we can’t have that.\nLet me get to the point. It’s this absolutely wonderful quote:\n“Now you just dig them in front. They have worries, they’re thinking about where to sleep tonight, how much money for gas, the weather, how they’ll get there – and all the time they’ll get there anyway. You see. But they need to worry and betray time with urgencies false and otherwise, purely anxious and whiny, their souls really won’t be at peace unless they can latch on to an established and proven worry and having once found it they assume facial expressions to fit and go with it, which is, you see, unhappiness, and all the time it all flies by them and they know it and that too worries them no end. Listen! Listen!……Man, you dig all this.”\nI worry that these days I might have started worrying a little – wee – bit less about a lot of things. You have a nice day!"

    "text": "For this til page listing, I used table type listing. It looks good but it was including author field, which was unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nquarto table listing by default\n\n\nEncouraged by the success of the previous effort to modify the default listing page, I wrote this in the .scss…\n.quarto-listing-table th:nth-child(3), td:nth-child(3) {\n    display:none;\n}\n…and that promptly removed the author column completely. ofcourse, I had to inspect, see the th and td are the 3rd ones, find the nth-child selector etc. but thats the details.\nHowever, this would impact all the table listings I would ever use. So, tried the same approach as before by defining body-classes in the listing page and including this in the .scss\n.til-page .quarto-listing-table th:nth-child(3), td:nth-child(3) {\n    display:none;\n}\nand that refused to work. Finally gaveup on that approach and decided to write a custom listing. That went the following.\nFirst, wrote an til-listing.ejs\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;table class=\"til-table\"&gt;\n    &lt;thead&gt;\n        &lt;th&gt;\n            Date\n        &lt;/th&gt;\n        &lt;th&gt;\n            Title\n        &lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;% for (const item of items) { %&gt;\n            &lt;tr&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;\n                    &lt;%= item['date'] %&gt;\n                &lt;/td&gt;\n\n                &lt;td&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"&lt;%- item.path %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%= item.title %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n                 &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;% } %&gt;\n\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nModified the listing page to include this .ejs as the template. template: ../_themes/til-listing.ejs\nthen, included the following in the .scss to pad properly. this was iterative. first wrote the above without the class, the table was looking crowded so looked up how to add padding.\n.til-table td {\n    padding:0px 20px 10px 0px;\n}\njust played around with the numbers till i got a good looking table.\nand, the listing page is changed. Categories is not working though. going to look into it next.\nUpdate:\nWhen Anand saw all this drama, he stepped in and changed the .ejs to this.\n\n```{=html}\n&lt;div class=\"til-listing list\"&gt;\n&lt;% for (const item of items) { %&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"til-item\" &lt;%= metadataAttrs(item) %&gt;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"til-item-header\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"til-item-date listing-date\"&gt;&lt;%= item['date'] %&gt;&lt;/dspan&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"til-item-categories\"&gt;\n                &lt;% for (const c of item.categories) { %&gt;\n                    &lt;span class=\"til-category listing-categories\"&gt;&lt;%= c %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;% } %&gt;\n            &lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"til-item-title\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;%- item.path %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"listing-name\"&gt;&lt;%= item.title %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;% } %&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nand added the following to .scss.\n\n.til-item {\n    margin: 20px 0;\n}\n\n.til-item-header {\n    color: #888;\n    font-size: 0.8em;\n}\n\n.til-category {\n    text-transform: uppercase;\n    color: #666;\n    background: #eee;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    padding: 0px 5px;\n    font-size: 0.7em;\n}\nnotice the &lt;%= metadataAttrs(item) %&gt; and such stuff, which is the result of followng this part pf the quarto guide on enabling sorting for custom listings.

To fix the issue, one needs to specify dependencies in the quarto document so that they are installed when the document is rendered.\nThere are many ways of doing it.\n\nspecify dependencies in the page header.\n\n    dependencies:\n        - numpy\n        - matplotlib\n\nAdd the dependendencies to the publish.yml document\n\n- name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        pip install numpy\n        pip install matplotlib\n        # Add other dependencies here\n\nAdd dependecies to a text document like requirements.txt and then use this to install dependencies through publish.yml. This has the advantage that all you need to do is keep the requirements.txt updated and that will take care of the dependencies.\n\n- name: Install dependencies\n        run: pip install -r requirements.txt\nNow, the file gets published and the code runs. Example code below.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport random\n\n# function generates random hex color\ndef random_hex_color():\n    return \"#{:06x}\".format(random.randint(0, 0xFFFFFF))\n\n# sets up the subplot\nfigure, axes = plt.subplots()\n\n# define radius of the center circle, around whose circumference other circles are drawn\n\nr = 10\n\n# Draw 24 circles with random colors, 2*np.pi angle is divided into 24 parts, each theta. the center of each circle is determined as r*cos theta and r*sin theta. at this center, circle is drawn with r as radius. \n\nfor i in range(24):\n    theta = i * (2 * np.pi / 24)\n    x1 = r * np.cos(theta)\n    y1 = r * np.sin(theta)\n    color = random_hex_color()\n    draw_circle = plt.Circle((x1, y1), r, fill=True, edgecolor='black',facecolor=color,alpha=0.2)\n    axes.add_artist(draw_circle) # this adds the circle to the plot. \n\n# draw the center circle, this is optional. \ndraw_center_circle=plt.Circle((0,0),10, fill=False, edgecolor='white')\naxes.add_artist(draw_center_circle)\n\n\n# the plot area aspect ratio and limits are setup\naxes.set_aspect(1)\naxes.set_xlim(-2*r, 2*r)\naxes.set_ylim(-2*r, 2*r)\n\n# Hide axes labels\naxes.set_xticks([])\naxes.set_yticks([])\n\n# Remove the border\nfor spine in axes.spines.values():\n    spine.set_visible(False)\n\nplt.show() # this displays the plot. important. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is sorted!"

    "text": "‘No one can craft a jutti like I do’\nజుత్తీ చేయటంలో నన్ను మించినవాళ్ళు లేరు\nIn the village of Rupana, veteran shoemaker Hans Raj is the only artisan who still makes leather juttis by hand, a craft requiring great skill and precision, and traditionally practised by Dalit families from Punjab\nరూపానా గ్రామంలో చెప్పులు కుట్టే వృత్తిలో చేయి తిరిగిన హన్స్ రాజ్ ఒక్కరికే ఇంకా చేతితో తోలు జుత్తీ కుట్టే పనితనం ఉంది. సాంప్రదాయికంగా పంజాబులో దళిత కుటుంబాలు చేస్తూ ఉన్న ఈ చేతిపని చేయటానికి చాలా నేర్పరితనము, సున్నితమైన ఖచ్చితత్వమూ కావాలి.\n“Lai de ve jutti mainu, Muktsari kadai wali, Pairan wich mere channa, jachugi payi bahali’’\n“లాయ్ దే వే జుత్తీ మేనూ, ముక్త్ సరీ కడాయీ వాలీ పైరన్ విచ్ మేరే ఛన్నా జచూగీ పాయి బహాలీ”\n“Buy me a jutti , the one with Muktsar’s embroidery, In my feet, oh my beloved, it will look amazing.”\n“ముక్తసర్ చేతికుట్టు పని చేసిన జుత్తీ నాకు కొనిస్తావా ప్రియా అందమైన నా పాదాలకి అవి ఎంత చక్కగా అమరుతాయో కదా”\nHans Raj tightens his grip on the coarse cotton thread. Using a sharp steel needle to guide it, the veteran shoemaker pierces the tough leather, skillfully moving the needle in and out roughly 400 times to hand-stitch a pair of Punjabi juttis (closed shoes). As he does so, his heavy sighs followed by ‘hmms’ punctuate the silence.\nతన చేతిలో ఉన్న బిరుసైన నూలు దారాన్ని ఇంకొంచెం బిగించి పట్టుకున్నారు హన్స్ రాజ్. మొనదేరిన స్టీలు సూది సహాయంతో ఆ దారాన్ని గట్టి తోలులోకి దించి, ఎంతో చాకచక్యంగా సూదిని కదిలిస్తూ, దగ్గర దగ్గర నాలుగు వందల కుట్లు వేస్తేనే ఒక జత పంజాబీ జుత్తీ (మూసిఉండే ఒకరకం చెప్పులు) తయారవుతాయి. ఆయన పని చేస్తున్నప్పుడు బరువైన నిట్టూర్పులు, ‘హుమ్మ్’ అనే శబ్దాలు తప్ప అంతా నిశ్శబ్దంగా ఉంటుంది.\nIn the village of Rupana in Sri Muktsar Sahib district of Punjab, Hans Raj is the only artisan who makes these juttis the traditional way.\nపంజాబులోని శ్రీ ముక్తసర్ సాహిబ్ జిల్లాలో, ఈ జుత్తీలని సాంప్రదాయక పద్ధతిలో తయారుచేయగల ఏకైక చేతిపనివాడు హన్స్ రాజ్ మాత్రమే.\n“Most people are unaware how a Punjabi jutti is made and who crafts it. There is a common misconception that machines make it. But from preparation to stitching, everything is done by hand,” says the 63-year-old artisan who has been crafting juttis for nearly half a century now. “Wherever you go, Muktsar, Malout, Gidderbaha or Patiala, no one can meticulously craft a jutti like I do,” Hans Raj says matter-of-factly.\n“చాలా మందికి పంజాబీ జుత్తీ ఎలా, ఎవరు తయారు చేస్తారో తెలియదు. అందరూ వీటిని యంత్రాలు చేస్తాయని అనుకుంటారు. కానీ, మొదటి నుంచీ చివరివరకూ, పూర్తిగా చేతితోనే తయారు అవుతాయి,” అంటారు హన్స్ రాజ్. అరవై మూడు సంవత్సరాల ఆయన, దాదాపు అర్థ శతాబ్దకాలంగా ఈ జుత్తీలను తయారు చేస్తున్నారు. “మీరు ఎక్కడికైనా వెళ్ళండి, ముక్తసర్, మాలౌత్, గిద్దర్బహా, కావాలంటే పటియాలా, నా అంత శ్రద్ధగా జుత్తీలు చేసేవాళ్ళు మీకు దొరకరు,” అని చాలా మామూలుగా అంటారు హన్స్ రాజ్.\nEvery day, starting at 7 a.m., he sits on a cotton mattress on the floor near the entrance of his rented workshop, part of the walls covered with a collection of Punjabi juttis for both men and women. A pair is priced between Rs. 400 to Rs. 1,600, and he says he can earn about Rs. 10,000 a month from this livelihood.\nప్రతి రోజూ ఉదయం ఏడు గంటల నుంచీ ఆయన తన అద్దె దుకాణం ద్వారం దగ్గర ఒక దూది పరుపు మీద కూర్చుని ఉంటారు. ఆ దుకాణం గోడలలో కొంత భాగం జుత్తీలతో నిండి ఉంటాయి. అందులో మగవాళ్ళ కోసం చేసినవి, ఆడవాళ్ళ కోసం చేసినవి కూడా ఉంటాయి. ఒక జత ఖరీదు 400 రూపాయల నుండీ 1600 రూపాయలకు ఉంటుంది. ఈ వృత్తి నుంచీ తనకు నెలకు 10,000 రూపాయల వరకూ సంపాదన ఉంటుందని చెప్పారు.\nLeft: Hans Raj’s rented workshop where he hand stitches and crafts leather juttis. Right: Inside the workshop, parts of the walls are covered with juttis he has made\nఎడమ: హన్స్ రాజ్ చేతితో కుట్టి, తోలు జుత్తీలు తయారు చేసే అద్దె దుకాణం. కుడి: దుకాణం లోపల గోడలు కొంతభాగం అతను తయారు చేసిన జుత్తీలతో నిండి ఉంటాయి.\nHansraj has been practicing this craft for nearly half a century. He rolls the extra thread between his teeth before piercing the tough leather with the needle\nఈ పనిని హన్స్ రాజ్ దాదాపు అర్థ శతాబ్దంగా చేస్తున్నారు. గట్టి తోలులోకి సూది దించేముందు దారాన్ని పళ్ల మధ్య పట్టి తిప్పుతారు.\nLeaning against the weathered wall, he spends the next 12 hours crafting handmade shoes. The place where he leans his tired back on the wall is patchy – the cement has worn off exposing the bricks underneath. “The body aches, especially the legs,” Hans Raj says, massaging his knee joints. In summer, he says, “We get dane je [boils] on the back from all the sweating that causes pain.”\nమాసిపోయిన ఆ గోడకి ఆనుకుని కూర్చుని, ఆయన రోజుకి పన్నెండు గంటల పాటు చేతితో చెప్పులు కుడుతూనే ఉంటారు. అతను అలసిపోయిన వీపుని ఆన్చి కూర్చునే చోట గోడ అరిగిపోయి ఉంది - సిమెంటు పెచ్చులు రాలి కింద ఉన్న ఇటుకలు కనిపిస్తున్నాయి. “ఒళ్ళు నొప్పులుగా ఉంటుంది, కాళ్లయితే మరీనూ,” అంటారు హన్స్ రాజ్, తన మోకాళ్ళ చిప్పలు రుద్దుకుంటూ. “వేసవి కాలంలో చెమట పోసి, వీపు మీద వచ్చే దానే జా (కురుపులు) బాగా నొప్పి పెడతాయి,” అంటారు.\nHans Raj learnt the craft when he was around 15, and he was tutored by his father. “I was more interested in exploring the outdoors. Some days I would sit down to learn, some days I would not.” But as he grew up and the pressure to work increased, so did the hours of being seated.\nహన్స్ రాజ్ తనకి పదిహేనేళ్ళ వయసులో, వాళ్ళ నాన్న దగ్గర ఈ వృత్తివిద్య నేర్చుకున్నారు. “అప్పట్లో నాకు బయట తిరగటం మీద ఎక్కువ ఆసక్తి ఉండేది. కొన్నిరోజులు కూర్చుని నేర్చుకునే వాడిని, కొన్నిరోజులు లేదు.” అయితే అతను పెద్దవాడు అయ్యే కొద్దీ పని చేయాలన్న వత్తిడి, కూర్చునే గంటలూ పెరిగాయి.\nSpeaking in a mix of Punjabi and Hindi he says, “this work needs bariki [precision].” Hans Raj has been working without glasses for years, “but I have started noticing changes to my eyesight now. If I work for many hours, my eyes feel the strain. I see two of everything.”\nపంజాబీ, హిందీ కలిపిన భాష మాట్లాడుతూ ఆయన, “ఈ పనికి చాలా బారీకీ (ఖచ్చితత్వం) కావాలి,” అంటారు. ఇన్ని సంవత్సరాలుగా కళ్ళద్దాల అవసరం లేకుండానే పనిచేశారు కానీ, “ఈ మధ్య కంటిచూపులో తేడా తెలుస్తుంది. కొన్ని గంటలు పనిచేసిన తర్వాత కళ్ళకి అలసట వస్తుంది. అన్నీ రెండుగా కనబడతాయి.”\nDuring a regular work day, he drinks tea and listens to the news, songs and cricket commentary on his radio. His favourite programme is the “ pharmaishi programme,” where listeners’ request of old Hindi and Punjabi songs are played. He himself has never called up the radio station to request any song saying, “I don’t understand numbers and can’t dial.”\nఅతను మామూలు పని రోజుల్లో టీ తాగుతూ, రేడియోలో పాటలు, వార్తలు, క్రికెట్ వ్యాఖ్యానము వింటూ ఉంటారు. శ్రోతలు కోరిన హిందీ, పంజాబీ పాటలు వినిపించే ‘ఫర్మాయిషీ కార్యక్రమం’ అతనికి ఇష్టమైన కార్యక్రమం. అయితే, అతను ఎప్పుడూ ఆ కార్యక్రమానికి ఫోను చేయలేదు. “నాకు అంకెలు అర్థం కావు, ఫోను కలపలేను,” అంటారు.\n‘I always start by stitching the upper portion of the jutti from the tip of the sole. The person who manages to do this right is a craftsman, others are not’, he says\n‘నేను ఎప్పుడూ చెప్పు అడుగు అట్ట కొననుంచీ జుత్తీ పై భాగం కుట్టటంతో మొదలు పెడతాను. అలా సరిగ్గా కుట్ట గలిగిన వాడు పని తెలిసిన కళాకారుడు, లేకపోతే లేదు’, అంటారు ఆయన.\nHans Raj has never been to school, but finds great joy in exploring new places beyond his village, especially with his friend, a holy man in the neighbouring village: “Every year we take a trip. He has his own car, and he often invites me to join him on travels. Together, with one or two more people, we’ve visited places in Haryana and Alwar and Bikaner in Rajasthan.”\nహన్స్ రాజ్ బడికి ఎప్పుడూ వెళ్లలేదు కానీ వాళ్ళ ఊరు దాటి కొత్త కొత్త ప్రదేశాలు చూడటం అంటే అతనికి ఎంతో సంతోషం. పక్క ఊళ్ళో మతపెద్దగా ఉన్న స్నేహితుడితో కలిసి వెళుతుంటారు. “ప్రతి సంవత్సరం, ఒక యాత్ర చేస్తాము. అతనికి సొంత కారు ఉంది, అందులో నన్ను కూడా తీసుకు వెళతాడు. ఇంకొక ఇద్దరు ముగ్గురితో కలిసి, మేము హర్యానాలో చాలా స్థలాలు, రాజస్థాన్ లో అల్వార్, బికనేర్ తిరిగి చూసాము.”\n\nIt is well past 4 p.m, and Rupana village is bathed in the warm glow of a lingering mid-November sun. One of Hans Raj’s loyal customers has arrived with a friend to pick up a pair of Punjabi juttis . “Could you also make a jutti for him by tomorrow?” he asks Hans Raj. The friend has come from far away – Tohana in Haryana – 175 kilometres from here.\nఅప్పటికి సాయంత్రం నాలుగు గంటలు దాటేసింది. రూపానా గ్రామం వదిలి పోలేక పోతున్న చలికాలపు సూర్యుడి వెచ్చటి వెలుగుతో నిండిపోయింది. ఎప్పటి నుంచో హన్స్ రాజ్ దగ్గర జుత్తీలు కొంటున్న ఖాతాదారుడు ఒకాయన, తన స్నేహితుణ్ణి కూడా తీసుకుని వచ్చారు. “ఇతనికి కూడా ఒక జుత్తీ కావాలి. రేపటి కల్లా చేస్తారా?” అని అడుగుతున్నారు అతను. ఆ స్నేహితుడు ఎంతో దూరం నుంచీ - హర్యానాలోని తోహానా - అంటే 175 కిలోమీటర్ల దూరం నుంచీ వచ్చారు.\nHans Raj smiles, responding to the customer’s request with a friendly, “ yaar , it is not possible by tomorrow.” The customer, however, is persistent: “Muktsar is renowned for Punjabi juttis .” The customer then turns to us saying, “there are thousands of jutti shops in the city. But here in Rupana, it is only he who crafts them by hand. We are familiar with his work.”\nహన్స్ రాజ్ చిన్నగా నవ్వుతూ, స్నేహంగా సమాధానం ఇచ్చారు, “రేపటికల్లా అంటే కుదరదు.” అయితే ఆ వచ్చిన ఖాతాదారుడు వదలలేదు: “ముక్తసర్ పంజాబీ జుత్తీలకి పేరు మోసింది.” అతను మావైపు తిరిగి, “పట్నంలో వేల కొద్దీ జుత్తీ దుకాణాలు ఉన్నాయి. కానీ ఇక్కడ రూపానాలో చేతితో జుత్తీలు తయారు చేసేది ఇతను ఒక్కడే. మాకు ఇతని పనితనం బాగా తెలుసు..”\nThe customer tells us that till Diwali, the entire shop was filled with juttis . A month later in November, only 14 pairs remain. What makes Hans Raj’s juttis so special? “The ones he makes are flatter in the middle,” the customer says, pointing to the juttis hanging on the wall, “The difference lies in the hands [of the craftsperson].\nకొనటానికి వచ్చిన ఆయన, దీపావళి వరకూ మొత్తం దుకాణం నిండా జుత్తీలు ఉంటాయని చెప్పారు. ఒక నేల తర్వాత నవంబర్లో 14 జతలు మాత్రం మిగిలిఉన్నాయి. హన్స్ రాజ్ జుత్తీల ప్రత్యేకత ఏమిటి? “ఈయన చేసే జుత్తీలు మధ్యలో చదునుగా ఉంటాయి,” గోడమీద జుత్తీలు చూపిస్తూ చెప్పారు. “ప్రత్యేకత పని తెలిసిన వాడి చేతిలో ఉంటుంది.”\n‘There are thousands of jutti shops in the city. But here in Rupana, it is only he who crafts them by hand,’ says one of Hans Raj’s customers\n‘పట్నంలో వేల కొద్దీ జుత్తీ దుకాణాలు ఉన్నాయి. కానీ ఇక్కడ రూపానాలో చేతితో జుత్తీలు తయారు చేసేది ఇతను ఒక్కడే’ అంటారు హన్స్ రాజ్ దగ్గర కొనేవాళ్ళలో ఒకరు\nHans Raj doesn’t work alone – he gets some of the juttis stitched by Sant Ram, a skilled shoemaker in his native village, Khunan Khurd, 12 kms away. During Diwali or the paddy season, when the demand is high, he outsources his work, paying Rs. 80 for stitching a pair.\nహన్స్ రాజ్ పని అంతా ఒక్కడే చేయరు - కొన్ని జుత్తీలు 12 కిలోమీటర్ల దూరంలో వాళ్ళ సొంత ఊరు ఖునన్ ఖుర్ద్ లో ఉండే సంత్ రామ్ అనే చెప్పులు కుట్టే నిపుణుడి చేత కుట్టిస్తారు. దీపావళి లేదా వరి పండే కాలంలో గిరాకీ ఎక్కువగా ఉన్నప్పుడు, ఒక్కొక్క జత 80 రూపాయల చొప్పున అతనితో కుట్టించుకుంటారు.\nThe master shoemaker tells us the difference between a craftsman and a workman: “I always start by stitching the panna [upper portion] of the jutti from the tip of the sole. This is the most challenging phase of crafting juttis . The person who manages to do this right is a mistiri [craftsman], others are not.”\nచేతి పని తెలిసిన కళాకారుడికీ, ఊరికే చేతి పనిచేసేవాడికీ తేడా ఏమిటో ఆయన ఇలా చెప్పారు: “నేను ఎప్పుడూ జుత్తీ యొక్క పన్నా (పై భాగం) అడుగు అట్ట చివరి నుంచీ కుట్టటం మొదలు పెడతాను. జుత్తీలు తయారు చేయటంలో ఇది అన్నిటికన్నా కష్టమైన భాగం. ఇది సరిగ్గా చేయగలిగిన వాడు మిస్త్రీ (చేతిపని తెలిసిన వాడు), లేకపోతే లేదు..”\nIt wasn’t a skill he learnt easily. “Initially, I was not good at stitching shoes with thread,” Hans Raj recalls. “But when I committed to learning it, I mastered it in two months. The rest of the skill I picked up over time, first by asking my father, and later by observing him,” he adds.\nఅయితే, ఆ విద్య ఆయనకి సులువుగా ఏమీ రాలేదు. “మొదట్లో నాకు దారంతో చెప్పులు కుట్టటం సరిగ్గా వచ్చేది కాదు,” అని గుర్తుచేసుకున్నారు హన్స్ రాజ్. “అయితే నేర్చుకోవాలని నేను నిశ్చయించుకున్న తర్వాత, రెండు నెలల్లో నేర్చేసుకున్నాను. ఇక మిగిలిన విద్య అంతా మెల్లగా నేర్చుకున్నాను. మొదట్లో మా నాన్నని అడిగి నేర్చుకునేవాడిని, తర్వాత చూసి నేర్చుకున్నాను.”\nOver the years, he has innovated, incorporating a technique of stitching small strips of leather on both sides of the jutti , seamlessly connecting all the joints. “These small strips add strength to the jutti . The shoes become more resistant to breakage,” he explains.\nసంవత్సరాల తరబడి పని చేయటంలో, అతను కొన్ని కొత్త ప్రక్రియలు కనిపెట్టారు. జుత్తీకి రెండు వైపులా, అన్ని అతుకులనీ కలుపుతూ చిన్న తోలు ముక్కలు కుట్టటం వాటిలో ఒకటి. “ఈ చిన్న ముక్కలు జుత్తీని బలంగా చేస్తాయి. చెప్పులు తొందరగా తెగకుండా ఉంటాయి,” అని వివరించారు.\nThe craft of jutti- making requires precision. ‘Initially, I was not good at stitching shoes with thread,’ he recalls. But once he put his mind to it, he learnt it in two months\nజుత్తీలు కుట్టే విద్యలో ఖచ్చితత్వం చాలా అవసరం. ‘మొదట్లో నాకు దారంతో చెప్పులు కుట్టటం సరిగ్గా వచ్చేది కాదు,’ అని గుర్తుచేసుకున్నారు. అయితే, నేర్చుకోవాలని అనుకున్న తర్వాత, రెండునెలల్లో నేర్చేసుకున్నారు.\nHans Raj and his family of four, including his wife, Veerpal Kaur, and two sons and a daughter – now married and parents themselves – relocated from Khunan Khurd to Rupana some 18 years ago. At that time, their eldest son, who is 36 now, began working at the paper mill in the village here.\nహన్స్ రాజ్, అతని నలుగురు మనుషుల కుటుంబంతో - భార్య వీర్ పాల్ కౌర్ - ఇప్పుడు పెళ్ళిళ్ళు చేసుకుని పిల్లలు ఉన్న - ఇద్దరు కొడుకులు, ఒక కూతురు - అందరూ ఖునాన్ ఖుర్ద్ నుండీ రూపానాకి 18 సంవత్సరాల క్రితం వచ్చారు. ఇప్పుడు 36 సంవత్సరాలు ఉన్న వాళ్ళ పెద్ద అబ్బాయి అప్పుడు ఇక్కడ పేపర్ మిల్లులో పనిచేయటం మొదలు పెట్టాడు.\n“It was mostly [Dalit] families who made juttis in Khunan Khurd, working from their homes. As time passed, the new generation didn’t learn the craft. And those who knew, passed away,” says Hans Raj.\n“ఖునన్ ఖుర్ద్ లో జుత్తీలు తయారు చేసే కుటుంబాలు దాదాపుగా అందరూ దళితులే. ఇళ్లలోనే పనిచేసేవాళ్ళు. కాలం గడిచే కొద్దీ, కొత్త తరం ఆ విద్య నేర్చుకోలేదు. తెలిసిన వాళ్ళు చనిపోయారు,” అన్నారు హన్స్ రాజ్.\nToday, in his old village, only three craftsmen, all from his community of Ramdasi Chamars (listed as Scheduled Caste in the state), are still engaged in the art of handcrafting Punjabi juttis while Hans Raj is the only one in Rupana.\nఇప్పుడు వాళ్ళ ఊళ్ళో ముగ్గురే చేతిపని కళాకారులు చేతితో పంజాబీ జుత్తీలు తయారు చేస్తున్నారు. అందరూ అతనిలాగే (ఆ రాష్ట్రంలో షెడ్యూల్ కులంగా గుర్తించబడిన) రామ్ దాసీ చమర్ కులానికి చెందినవారు రూపానాలో అయితే హన్స్ రాజ్ ఒక్కరే.\n“We saw no future for our children in Khunan Khurd, so we sold our property there and bought one here,” Veerpal Kaur says, her voice a mix of determination and hope. She speaks fluent Hindi, a result of the diversity in the neighbourhood which is populated by migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, many of whom work in the paper mill and live in rented rooms in the vicinity.\nమాకు ఖునన్ ఖుర్ద్ లో పిల్లలకి భవిష్యత్తు ఏమీ కనపడలేదు , అందుకే అక్కడ స్థలం అమ్మేసి ఇక్కడ కొనుక్కున్నాం,” అని చెప్పారు వీర్ పాల్ కౌర్. ఆమె గొంతులో ఒక నిశ్చయం, ఒక ఆశ కలిసి వినిపించాయి.\nVeerpal Kaur, Hans Raj’s wife, learnt to embroider juttis from her mother-in-law. She prefers to sit alone while she works, without any distractions\nIt takes her about an hour to embroider one pair. She uses sharp needles that can pierce her fingers if she is not careful, Veerpal says\nThis is not the first time Hans Raj’s family has migrated. “My father came to Punjab from Narnaul [in Haryana] and started making juttis ,” says Hans Raj.\nA 2017 study by the Guru Nanak College of Girls in Sri Muktsar Sahib district shows that thousands of jutti -makers families migrated from Rajasthan to Punjab in the 1950s. Hans Raj’s ancestral village Narnaul is situated on the border of Haryana and Rajasthan.\n\n“When I started, a pair would only cost Rs. 30. Now a full embroidered jutti can cost over Rs 2,500,” Hans Raj recounts.\nFrom the small and large scattered pieces of leather at his workshop, Hans Raj shows us two kinds: cowhide and buffalo hide. “The buffalo hide is used for the sole, and the cowhide is for the upper half of the shoes,” he explains, his hands stroking the raw material that once formed the backbone of the craft.\nAs he holds up the tanned cowhide he asks if we are comfortable touching the animal skin. When we express our willingness, he goes on to observe not just the tanned leather but the contrast. The buffalo hide feels as thick as 80 paper sheets stacked together. The cowhide, on the other hand, is much thinner, maybe around 10 paper sheets. In terms of texture, the buffalo hide has a smoother and stiffer feel, while the cowhide, though slightly rougher, exhibits greater flexibility and ease of bending.\nHans Raj opens a stack of thick leather pieces that he uses to make the soles of the jutti . ‘Buffalo hide is used for the sole, and the cowhide is for the upper half of the shoes,’ he explains\nLeft: He soaks the tanned buffalo hide before it can be used. Right: The upper portion of a jutti made from cow hide\nThe growing hike in leather prices – his critical raw material – and the switch to shoes and slippers what he calls, “ boot-chappal ” has led to a fall in the number of people willing to take up this profession.\nHans Raj treats his tools with great care. For shaping the jutti he uses a rambi (cutter) to carve and scrape the leather; a morga (wooden hammer) for beating it until it is stiff and more. The wooden morga belonged to his father as did a deer horn which he uses to shape the tip of the shoes from inside as it is difficult to fix only with his hands.\nThe shoemaker travels to the shoe market in Jalandhar, 170 kms away from his village, to buy the tanned hides. To reach the mandi (wholesale market), he takes a bus to Moga and another from Moga to Jalandhar. His travel costs add up to over Rs. 200 one way.\nHis most recent journey took place two months prior to Diwali when he acquired 150 kilograms of tanned leather, valued at Rs. 20,000. Has he ever faced any trouble carrying the leather, we ask him. “The concern is more about transporting untanned leather than the tanned one,” he clarifies.\nHans Raj takes great care of all his tools, two of which he has inherited from his father\nhe wooden morga [hammer] he uses to beat the leather with is one of his inheritances\nHe visits the mandi to carefully choose the desired quality of leather, and the traders arrange for its transportation to a nearby city, Muktsar where he collects it. “Carrying such heavy material alone on the bus is anyway not possible,” he remarks.\nOver the years, the material for making juttis has evolved and younger shoemakers like Raj Kumar and Mahinder Kumar of the Guru Ravidas colony in Malout say that artificial leather such as rexine and micro cellular sheets are now more commonly used. Raj and Mahinder, both in their early forties, belong to the Dalit Jatav community.\n“Where a micro sheet cost Rs. 130 per kg, the cowhide now costs ranging from Rs. 160 to over Rs. 200 per kg,” says Mahinder. They say leather has become a rare commodity in the area. “Earlier, the colony was full of tanneries and a stench of untanned leather hung in the air. But as the basti grew, the tanneries were shut down,” says Raj.\nYoungsters are no longer keen on joining the profession, they add, and low income is not the only reason. “The stench gets into the clothes,” Mahinder says, “and sometimes their friends won’t shake their hands.”\noung shoemakers like Raj Kumar (left) say that artificial leather is now more commonly used for making juttis . In Guru Ravidas Colony in Malout where he lives and works, tanneries have shut\n“In my own family the children don’t make juttis ,” says Hans Raj, “my sons never entered the shop to understand the craft, how could they have learned it? Ours is the last generation now to know the skill. I may also be able to do it for another five years, after me who else will do it?” he asks.\nAs she chops vegetables for dinner, Veerpal Kaur says, “It isn’t possible to build homes by just making juttis . Almost two years ago, the family completed the construction of a pucca house, facilitated by their eldest son’s employee loan from the paper mill.\n“I had also asked her to learn embroidery, but she didn’t learn it all,” Hans Raj says, teasing his wife . The two have been married for 38 years. “I wasn’t interested,” Veerpal chimes back. Based on what she learnt from her mother-in-law, she can embroider a pair in an hour at home with zari thread.\nTheir home, shared with their eldest son’s family of three, comprises two rooms, a kitchen, and a drawing room, with an outdoor toilet. Adorning the rooms and hall are photos of B.R. Ambedkar and Sant Ravidas. A similar image of the saint graces Hans Raj’s workshop.\nans Raj’s juttis have travelled across India with their customers. These are back in vogue after a gap of about 15 years. Now, ‘every day feels like Diwali for me,’ a joyous Hans Raj says\n“It is in the last 10-15 years that people have started wearing juttis again,” Veerpal says,“before that, many had also stopped asking for the shoemakers.”\nDuring that time, Hans Raj worked as a farm labourer and occasionally crafted juttis within a day or two when a customer came by.\n“Now, more college going boys and girls are interested in wearing these juttis ,” Veerpal says.\nCustomers have also carried juttis to various places, including Ludhiana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Hans Raj fondly recalls crafting eight pairs of Punjabi juttis for a mill worker during his last big order. The mill worker purchased them for his relatives in Uttar Pradesh.\nSince there’s a consistent demand for his craftsmanship in his current location, “Every day feels like Diwali for me,” a joyous Hans Raj says.\nIn November 2023, a few weeks after this story was reported, Hans Raj suffered a partial stroke. He is now recovering.\nThis story is supported by a fellowship from Mrinalini Mukherjee Foundation (MMF).\n#leather #dalit #leather-worker #dalit-communities #craftpersons\nSanskriti Talwar\nSanskriti Talwar is an independent journalist based in New Delhi, and a PARI MMF Fellow for 2023.\nNaveen Macro\nNaveen Macro is a Delhi-based independent photojournalist and documentary filmmaker and a PARI MMF Fellow for 2023.\nEditor : Sarbajaya Bhattacharya\nSarbajaya Bhattacharya is a Senior Assistant Editor at PARI.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Notes from the reading\n\n“if Hindus migrate to other regions of earth, Indian caste will become a world problem.”\n\nDr. Ambedkar sets up the importance of studying caste. Caste is a parceling out of a homogenous population. Various definitions of caste are then examined and the characteristics of caste proposed in the definitions are separated into results of caste system (ideas of pollution and purity, prohibition of inter-dining) and the essential nature of caste. It is emphasized that caste exists within a system of castes and not as an isolated entity. Between autogeny and endogamy, endogamy is established as the essence of caste.\nThen there is a discussion of the imposition of endogamy on the system of exogamy that is practiced in India. Practices of widow burning, imposing a life long widowhood and child marriage are established as practices that were needed to prevent problem of surplus man and surplus woman, necessary to maintain endogamy and caste.\nThe nature of the argument - if you take a natural exogamous society, if we superimpose endogamy, what are the potential problems? What solutions can solve these problems? If we show that these solutions are present in the current society, we can argue that endogamy was created at a certain time. and that it did not come from a divine origin.\nAmbedkar makes this argument to attack the idea of divine origin - since the divine origin theory is where Brahminical position derives its strength.\ntraditions are honored because they are practiced. origin of the caste is the origin of the mechanism for endogamy\nSociety is composed not of individuals but classes. Caste is an enclosed class.\nhowever, one cannot say that a law giver like Manu or a group like brahmins created caste. It is impossible for one person or one group to do so. Shastras could also not have been able to create this. At best, they provided justifications for it.\nHow did classes end up becoming enclosed? The classses must have enclosed themselves to preserve their privileges. Most likely, Brahmins closed the doors of their class and became a caste. This is established by noticing that the practices necessary to maintain endogamy are more strictly followed by them. Everyone else imitated. Everyone else imitated because Brahmins were the highest in prestige. They were the servants of good, semi-gods and demi-gods.\n\nGabriel Tarde - three laws of imitation, hold good in the way caste is practiced.\n\nSome closed the door and the others found it closed against them. Anyone who violated caste rules was expelled and new castes were created. Fissiparous nature of the caste system.\ncaste as a unit within the system of castes - a singular caste does not exist. it is always the plural castes. it is an unconscious growth in the life of a human society in peculiar circumstances and not a conscious command of the supreme authority."

    "text": "I am one of the breed derogatorily referred to as ‘bleeding hearts’. Among other things, we believe that organised retail drives small business out of the market and therefore it is bad. We are all for entrepreneurship and think that an unorganised/informal market is good for entrepreneurship. In fact, it has been argued (not always by bleeding hearts) that the presence of ‘a billion entrepreneurs’ is a factor working for Indian Economy.\nI took a course in Social Entrepreneurship at the B school. In one of the classes, I remember the professor getting indignant at the thought of house wives haggling with puch-cart vegetable vendors over a couple of rupees. The push-cart guy goes to the wholesale market at 5 am on foot and comes back (a likely distance of about 10 km) pushing about 20-30 kg of vegetables. The idea is that it is indecent to deny that guy a couple of rupees for the effort. We all agreed with the professor.\nSo, whenever I am entrusted with the task of buying vegetables, I go to the small market/push carts instead of going to the Heritage Fresh, a supermarket nearer home. Over a period of time, I have noticed that the price of vegetables is consistently higher in the market. Still, I used the ‘poor push-cart guy’ argument and would pay the extra couple of rupees. The fact that the vegetables in the market are fresher than what the Heritage Fresh can offer, despite its infrastructure on the cold storage front, added a little practical rationale.\nToday, I went out to the market to buy some bottle gourd. I noticed that a push cart had really nice, tender looking ones. The lady manning the cart obviously saw my interest as I made way towards the cart. I didn’t probably help matters when I was specific about which gourds I wanted. I picked two (clearly weighing less than a kg) and she dropped a bombshell…twenty five rupees!! Even with my limited exposure to the market, I knew it was a clear case of over-pricing. I had to start haggling and she refused to give any discount. While I was leaving, I could hear her making disparaging remarks to the people around (most probably about jeans-clad, jacket-wearing idiots and their ignorance of realities of life).\nI made way to the Heritage Fresh and there, as you have figured out now, the gourd was at half the price. That started me thinking. It is probably the presence of such price arbitration that makes people haggle. Once you suspect such an arbitration is possible, you start looking at every price with abundant caution. There is also the added angle of ‘being made a fool of’. A supermarket might make fools of everyone but being made a fool of, in isolation, is more difficult to handle. You are more cautious agreeing to a price.\nIt also made me think of another angle. One of the arguments used against subsidized loans is that since the loan is subsidized, most of the times it is put to uses that give less than optimal returns. Thus, you are encouraging some one to engage in a less productive occupation by giving him a subsidized loan. Looked at this way, if there are enough people who are sensitive to the price arbitration between the two markets or if there is a possibility that the arbitration will become noticeable to a larger number of people and they will switch to supermarkets, may be we are making a mistake in supporting the ‘poor push-cart guy’ with a price subsidy of sorts.\nUnfortunately or otherwise, there is one more angle that I can think of. In the excellent article titled Kashmir: youth bulge, peace deficit in The Hindu today (I would strongly recommend a reading of this article, even if the current one has already bored you), Praveen Swami says the current political crisis in Kashmir has, among many others, an economic cause. He cites studies, focusing on English civil wars, European revolutions, rise of fascism in Germany and ethnic violence in Kenya, that point to a link between political violence and an increase in the number of young adult males in proportion to the total male population. In other words, too many young (or old, if you think about it) people with too little to do mean trouble.\nThe point that Swami makes is quite compelling. Looked at this way, the subsidy part of the subsidized loans and the higher prices you pay in local markets, if it helps to keep a large population in employment, may not be that high a price to pay.\nAll that I can conclude is that the complications seem a little too complex. Where you buy your bottle gourd has implications for the long-term political stability of the country, if you are jobless enough to think through all this. Even if you are not, I would appreciate a little help, by way of your comments, in getting to terms with the complexity."

There is.)\nI am personally very happy that this humble beginning is taking place in the right setting…on a restaurant table after a very satisfying beer and a biryani.\nBy the way, did you ever smell out a restaurant??\nI am in Bangalore on a life or death mission and the various things have been slowly falling in place. Four days in to the mission, most things are taken care of and then the final piece slowly slid in to place. In the associated excitement/relief, i realized only at 3 pm that i hadn’t had any meal. And i was in the unfamiliar environs of Bangalore on the 100 feet road in Indiranagar. I kept walking in the hope that there will be something on the road somewhere.\nSuddenly there was this whiff of spicy cooking…the only thing visible in the distance was a Cafe Coffee day which is like the farthest thing on your mind when you are looking for a good solid lunch…but still, my nose urged me on…i kept sniffing and walking…and sniffing and walking..and there it was…an “ANNAACHI, Truly chettinad” place hidden high above the coffee day. While slowly climbing the stairs I called the missus and told her of my awesome achievement. she was kind enough to say “very good, go eat now”…like she does with my kid. You know, she is had experience.\nThere was this sign on the door to tempt people like me “DLF IPL OFFER…ORDER TWO PINT BOTTLES OF BEER AND GET THE THIRD FREE, FREE, FREE”. I look at the menu and there is the scam in the open. A full bottle (MRP Rs.80) at Rs. 130 and a pint bottle (MRP Rs.41) priced at Rs. 100. All that the guy is offering me is the convenience of having one and half beer instead of having to order two beers. The price remains the same. Given the heat (of the moment and outside), i consider this favorably compared to the offer the other restaurant gave (one beer free for two – you kind of convince yourself in to having all the three) and go for it. Note for the missus: It was REALLY HOT, you know!!\nAnyway, the deed is done…they are closing down for the afternoon and i am going to the Coffee day downstairs for a nice hot coffee…"

    "text": "I was on a day long train journey the other day and found this book on my kindle app. Just about 15 years after it was published, I managed to read it.\nMaybe that’s a good thing – I am not totally sure I would have liked it at that time. I had heard people criticising it for portraying Draupadi ’s love for Karna, and taking other liberties with the story.\nReading it now, I see how the story of Mahabharata told from Draupadi ’s point of view would have been slightly ahead of its time. It has unmistakable feminist themes and rightly so. When one starts looking at our epics and myths carefully, it’s easy to see it is the strong women that make the stories what they are, while the men get all the accolades and devotion.\n The story starts with Draupadi recounting her birth story and ends with her fall on the ascent to heaven. The use of palaces – her father’s, the one in Hastinapura and the palace of illusions she builds for herself – as strong metaphors for her life and state of mind struck me as wonderful. Draupadi’s growth and evolution from a girl to young bride to queen, as well as the dynamic relationship between her, Kunti and the five brothers is described in realistic, human terms. Her mystical relationship with her brother Dhrishtadyumna and her sakha Krishna is enchanting.\nNeedless to say, I liked it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in getting a different perspective. Moreover, while the point of view is different, the philosophical lessons of the epic remain equally relevant and strong.\nI can also assure you there are no major deviations from the story as you know it, and the liberties taken are well within acceptable bounds from an author’s perspective. Draupadi is not portrayed as a helpless victim of the patriarchal politics around her but as a willing, enthusiastic, and adept participant with a strong mind of her own. That’s beautiful in itself.\nNow that I think about it, maybe there is one single instance where I thought a couple of lines were out of character. That’s about it.\nNow that I have read this, her writing that hagiography feels more of a betrayal. However, such is life, as Panchaali would tell you."

The injury is serious and an emergency surgery is scheduled. The surgeon walks into the room and says, “my god, this is my son!!” How is this possible?\nWe were waiting for the kids to realise that it appears impossible at first because they automatically assume the surgeon is male. We expect them to then reason and realise the surgeon could be a woman and so the boy’s mother. We were waiting for a neat trick to unfold, showing up the children’s biases. Instead, one of the kids says, “it’s a gay couple.” Now it’s our turn to wonder what biases we the adults are operating from. These kids, I am telling you!! ☺️"

    "section": "",
    "text": "It has been 4 years since Subba passed away. I first met him in 2006, when we went to Timbactu to study their education model as part of a course in Social Entrepreneurship.\nBelow are a few extracts from a report we submitted at the end of the project. Also sharing a post I wrote last year, about 15 years later, which kind of compliments the writing below.\nIn the last 15 years, I have not come across a single reason to change my opinion about Subba, his passion, dedication, and overall awesomeness. We are fortunate to have known him, and at Sambhavam and Farm Hill, we continue to be guided by his vision and wisdom and celebrate him practically every day.\nBegin Quote:\nOur first reaction on seeing Subba was one that of disbelief. The principal question bothering our minds was why would a doctorate from an IIT choose to teach primary school children and live a lifestyle that is incredibly so simple? To top it all, he was not even from an elite family which was already well off. He was in fact a first-generation literate from a family which perhaps needed his financial support. As stated earlier, he did not fall into any of our known paradigms of life. … When asked to Subba himself, he kind of got around the question saying that he did not like a “nine to five” job and was perhaps lazy to do the usual jobs that he could have got. Of course, he did talk about his dreams from childhood on ‘changing the country’ and ‘providing high quality education to every child’. Though these childhood dreams explain to some extent his current passion, they do not explain them in their entirety. There are obviously some other factors too which made him embrace his current lifestyle. …\nSubba for us, personified the very anti-thesis of the incentive-based mechanism that we were so much used to as MBA students. By being with him and talking to him, we were able to recognize and appreciate that other forms of mechanisms were possible as well. This apart, his humility and modesty were some things that ought to be seen to be believed. Very rarely do people come across with the entire package – passion, dedication, open mindedness, intelligence and humility. Suffice to say that, we consider ourselves lucky to have had the chance to meet him.\n\nWhen questioned about expectations from his children, he says that they would be given Timbaktu education till they reach tenth standard so that they have a ‘happy childhood’. Later, they could pursue their own interests. Developing self-reliance and enjoying one’s childhood are the key things that he wants to give them. He believes that his children would understand this paradigm in the future.\n\nThese things apart, our own perception of what constitutes a good education for a child (the original problem that we started with) also has changed. So much so that, if we were to think or talk about education some time down the line, ‘happy childhood’ and ‘joy of learning’ would be the foremost in our minds.\n\nIn effect, it is not necessary for Bablu or Mary or Subba to set up Timbaktus all over. If the rest of the world can see, learn and adopt this model where “providing a happy childhood” is the most important mandate of a school that would be success enough.\nEnd Quote."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A visit to a library, any library, typically makes me very happy. The notion of standing surrounded by so many books on so many topics by so many authors is in itself very exciting. A super market also makes me happy for a similar reason.The mere knowledge of the existence of certain products fills me with a strange kind of satisfaction. The tuna fish packed in brine is a special favorite of mine though I have never been able to convince myself into buying it. Less forbidding things that I have tried include methi bread, a lollipop priced at 25 rupees, Saint grape juice (it tastes faintly like wine) and so on.\nThe other reason I like supermarkets is the awesome quality of the human interactions: between shoppers (my favorite is when someone comes and asks me – “where do you guys keep detergent powders hidden?” with a touch of annoyance), between the shoppers and the shop assistants, between various assistants, the jumble of languages…after all, it’s a market! The indifference of some of the assistants, the poor English they speak, the righteous indignation of some of the shoppers…all these can get quite amusing. A Saturday morning visit to a supermarket near home in Bangalore has become a kind of pastime for me.\nOne such Saturday morning, the supermarket was almost empty. I admired the fifteen varieties of breakfast breads for sometime and spent some more time gazing at all the ‘phorein’ vegetables like zuchini, multi-colored capsicum, various grasses like rosemary, chinese cabbage and so on. And finally, as the point of time when missus would call from home asking ‘why the *@#$ is it taking you so long to buy a packet of milk’ was approaching, I reached the cash counter.\nThere was a lady standing at the counter ready to pay the bill. Well dressed, well made up but slightly over the hill. Suddenly she started speaking very unkindly to the girl in the counter. The register was showing a bill for 10,000 rupees and the lady was getting angry. The girl in the counter, to her credit, pointed out the problem immediately: there was a banana stem priced at 9,000 rupees. She immediately called her supervisor over. The supervisor noticed that the banana stem was weighed (by the lady) at 1000 grams. It should have been sold at 9 rupees per piece but when you get it weighed, the scanner looks at the 1000 and multiplies it by the piece rate of 9 rupees. It was a series of small mistakes (the lady deciding to getting it weighed when it was to be bought per piece, the weighing counter girl not correcting the mistake and the girl at the cash register going with the weight instead of billing by piece) and was easy to spot and rectify.\nAll this discussion took about 5 minutes and while it was going on, suddenly, the lady decided to up the ante. She started shouting that the girls in the counter do not know how to read numbers and that they do not even know how to read English letters. It was generally unfair but, okay, she was upset. Then she outdid herself by asking for the manager – she does not want that particular girl in the counter. And she started justifying her stand saying ‘people are busy, look how many people are having to wait because of such stupid mistakes’ and stuff. This was when she looked back at me and tried to include me in the ‘busy people’ waiting: I promptly stepped out of the sweep of her hand and looked away. Busy? you mean, ME??\nI felt like asking some questions: Assume the manager comes and she tells him not to put that girl in the counter. How is she going to ensure this happens? Is she going to come back at odd hours on sudden inspection visits? And if all the girls get ‘Fluent English’ training, will they continue to work as shop assistants? Especially if they start understanding all the things that we say about them? And some more questions: Why do we assume that people who are not smartly dressed are not sensitive to words like ‘stupid’? Would you call a fully grown adult ‘stupid’ in your mother tongue, however big the mistake s/he made? Okay, would you do the same in a regular vegetable market? They will hound you out, no matter how impeccable your English.\nAll this drama was being enacted at one counter and everyone was engaged, having fun like I was. Including a smart looking young lady at the next counter. A middle aged, lower middle class looking guy just steps across in front of her and gets his one packet of bread billed. The lady suddenly wakes up. She has a ton of things to get billed. She gets upset. The guy does not even look at her. She gets more upset and starts mumbling. That guy looks at her, smiles and shows his single packet of bread. She gets outraged and starts talking about ‘common courtesies’ like asking her leave before jumping queue and all. In rather rude sounding English. She does not expect him to talk back. He does not look like the kind that can give it back in English. Unfortunately for her, he does give it back, and does it rather well. Both of them are upset now.\nI felt like asking more questions: what would she have done if he had asked her – said NO NO NO? Not likely. Then why is she bothered now? Reminds me of the “take the smaller piece of the cake when you get the first chance” kind of thought.\nDid I ask any of these questions? Did I even politely express my opinion, at least to show off my ‘balanced outlook’? Did I try to bring peace back to the universe? No way. Either of the women would have easily summoned enough energy to thrash me black and blue if I had. No chance.\nBut, I have a plan. I am waiting another fifteen years. By that time, when I indulge in such perilious undertakings, the ladies will look at my awesome physique and thinning hair and will hopefully think – “okay, eccentric old man…let him live” and move on. Till then, mum’s the word."

    "text": "Once there was an oak tree. It grew big and strong, as oak trees generally do. It did not know any other way of growing. When wind blew, it moved happily but as it grew older, firmness set into its limbs.\nOne monsoon, there grew a clump of grass under the oak tree. The blades of grass grew thin and straight, as blades of grass grow anywhere. They really danced with joy in the wind. The oak tree looked on, sighing.\nOne day there was a storm. The blades of grass survived. The oak tree was uprooted. Same as happened countless times to countless other oak trees and blades of grass in countless other storms. But this time, a wise man was passing by. The wise man got immortalized by asking “which is stronger, a mighty Oak tree or a blade of grass?” and quickly answering “in a monsoon, the tree broke like a twig but the blades of grass that yielded remained standing.”\nAs this observation took the form of a moral tale depicting the “fall of the proud oak tree”, the fallen but not yet dead oak tree also had to endure the taunts and boasts of the surviving grass blades. Till the time summer came and baked both the grass and the oak tree a dull, dead brown."

    "text": "On the morning walk today, we went slightly off the usual path. We took a couple of new turns, walked through a couple of fences. Went up a small hill and down the other side. Then another hill.\nFrom the top, we could see three familiar paths, one each side. We collected a few Pongamia pods to plant in the nursery. Then we took a path down the hill, to join one of the paths that would take us back to farm hill.\nOnce we hit the familiar path, we took right instead of left. A little along the path, a left instead of the usual right, on to a cart track. As if we were searching for something.\n We could see the path stretching ahead of us to the next hill and we knew it would wind round to farm hill. That’s when we found what we weren’t looking for.\n A tree of White Gulmohar, Delonix Elata. We had seen a few of these trees around. The last time we saw another tree along another path, it had only flowers. And the flowers are beautiful.\n This tree looked, big, dense, and inviting. We rushed to it as if it was calling us. The flowers were beautiful, the sky was blue, and it had fruits. And the dry fruits on the ground, many of them had seeds! We walked around picking up the fruits and collecting seeds, only the fat ones.\n       The other side of the tree, we saw, was a shrine, that is when we noticed the sacred fig intertwined with this tree. The stems were nearly the same color, difficult to tell apart.\n It was magical, I am telling you, finding the beautiful, sacred tree, while weren’t looking for it. And now we have seeds, wild ones, to put in the nursery!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Just completed a project – young team, tight timelines, new technical tools etc. and sat down to think about how it went, what went right/wrong and so on. In such an exercise, while one can identify areas that can be improved, the question “What went wrong?” does not have a single, definitive answer. There are a bunch of relatively small things that go wrong, that finally contribute to what visibly goes wrong.\nAs I was thinking about it, was reminded of this question – “who killed Karna?” which, incidentally, was asked much before “who killed palomino Molero?” Arjuna asks this question and Krishna answers: “By you, by me, by your mother Kunti, by the lord Indra, by mother earth and by his guru Parashurama. If you think about it, Karna was killed by six of us.”\nFor those that can read Telugu, the poem goes like this:\nనీ చేతను నా చేతను\nవరమడిగిన కుంతి చేత వాసవు చేతన్\nధర చేత భార్గవు చేతన్\nఅరయంగా కర్ణుడీల్గె నార్వురి చేతన్\n(వాసవుడు = ఇంద్రుడు; భార్గవుడు = పరశురాముడు; అరయంగా = చూస్తే, ఆలోచిస్తే; కర్ణుడు+ఈల్గె = కర్ణుడు చనిపోయాడు)\nWhat Krishna is saying, is that there are lots of things that contributed to Karna’s death, the principal contributions coming from these six. He was also probably trying to assuage the guilt felt by Arjuna after discovering that Karna was also the eldest son of Kunti, and therefore an elder brother.\nNow for the stories of these six contributions:\nBy you – Arjuna was the one who actually kills Karna in the battle\nBy me – Krishna is the one who plotted it (and directed the entire war, by the way)\nBy Kunti – before the beginning of the war, Kunti goes to Karna, tells him the secret o his birth and asks for a boon. Karna agrees to not kill any of the Pandavas, other than Arjuna. This puts him at a huge disadvantage.\nBy Lord Indra – according to the legend, Arjuna is the son of Indra. Karna was born with golden armor that made him impossible to kill. So, before the beginning of the war, Indra goes to him in the guise of a Brahmin and asks him for the armor as a gift. Since Karna also took this oath saying he will grant anyone what he asks for, he was obliged to part with the armor, becoming vulnerable.\nBy mother earth – Once a little girl spills some ghee and was crying because her mother would scold her for that. Karna, passing that way, wants to help and squeezes the mother earth till the ghee oozes back, pure. Mother earth gets angry at this and curses him saying she will not support his chariot in the most crucial battle of his life. The chariot actually gets stuck during the final battle.\nBy his guru parashurama – Parashurama took an oath saying he will not teach any king or one born into a ruling family and teaches only Brahmins. Karna goes to him in the guise of a Brahmin and learns the secrets of weapons from him. When parashurama discovers this, he curses Karna saying the knowledge he acquired by deceit, will not help him in his moment of need.\nOne would also notice that in all these six cases, and generally for most of his life, Karna was actually betrayed by his good intentions. That’s a story for another day."

I don’t want to carry handcrafted Marseille soap, or tsampa and yak butter, or nine thousand varieties of wine. Half the shops here don’t open till noon and even the bookstore’s brined in charm. I want to be the one store that’s open all night and has nothing but necessities. Something to get a fire going and something to put one out. A place where things stay frozen and a place where they are sweet. I want to hold within myself the possibility of plugging one’s ears and easing one’s eyes; superglue for ruptures that are, one would have thought, irreparable, a whole bevy of non-toxic solutions for everyday disasters. I want to wait brightly lit and with the patience I never had as a child for my father to find me open on Christmas morning in his last-ditch, lone-wolf drive for gifts. “Light of the World” penlight, bobblehead compass, fuzzy dice. I want to hum just a little with my own emptiness at 4 a.m. To have little bells above my door. To have a door.\nChristian Wiman is the Clement-Muehl Professor of Communication Arts at Yale Divinity School, the former editor of Poetry magazine, and the author, editor, and translator of multiple books.

During this period, I was reminded a few times to save my data – pictures, testimonials and scraps (how weird this word sounds now!!). I ignored all of them.\nLast night, I was trying to put together a face book album for my son’s 10th birthday, with a picture from each of the 9 previous birthdays. Suddenly, we found we were missing birthday pictures from 2009. After a bit of all round panic and searching through a couple of drives, missus remembered that there was an album on Orkut.\nBut Orkut shutdown in 2014! They reminded us to download data and we ignored!! An immediate Google search then revealed that there is still a way to get the pictures. You go to Google Takeout, log in, make a couple of choices and, your data is downloaded. You can save it to the drive as well.\nAnd that is when I noticed the deadline was September 2016, and had I not run into this difficulty this week, I would have lost a few important pictures. Hence this post!\nNow that I have the data, I went through it and discovered that about 70% the friends I had on Orkut are still my friends on Facebook. I am thinking of getting in touch with some of the remaining 30%…should be fun!\nI am looking forward to it and if you are in that 30%, you have been warned 🙂"

    "text": "1. First thing I noted was how similar the body language and diction of some of the modern gurus, especially Ravi shankar is to that of Rajneesh.\n 2. In the first two epoisodes, I was stuck by how the narrative was completely driven from the point of view of Rajneeshees but was aware of this as a plot device.\n  3. It was also intriguing to know involvement of Nike cofounder in this. And that there is a lot of influence peddling, from Antelope. How else can a community of 40 people stand up to a corporation the size and influence of Rajaneesh?\n 4. And the fear of the unknown and the kind of religious blasphemy that Rajaneeshees presented to the locals.\n 5. From part 2 onwards, it was clear to see that despite their positions within a very influential cult that has so many followers, neither Sheela nor Niren really understood how to influence public opinion. They are arrogant and turn everyone against themselves.\n 6. In E3, I was stuck by their callousness in recruiting the homeless street people to their project and the choosing to sedate and abandon them once they prove to be no longer useful.\n 7. In E4, the internal politics of a closely run group and how they can influence what happens are shown beautifully.\n 8. In E5 and parts of E6, the entire blame is shifted to Sheela. While the group close to her is mentioned repeatedly, she is presented as the king pin. Even Jane gets a pass.\n 9. Sheela remains without empathy. Her language, her thinking and all justify the bad light she is shown in.\n 10. Surprisingly, Rajaneesh is also shown to be more or less out of this loop. If mountains of evidence was collected, and seeing how actively he engages and responds after sheela left, isnt it surprising his role is not focused on?\n 11. The continuing affiliation of Niren with Rajaneeshees? Does it continue? 12. Is it an attempt by the rajaneeshees to clear Osho’s name? Is this in lieu of the book he asked Niren to write?"

    "text": "by Billy Collins\nIt is so early almost nothing has happened. Agriculture is an unplanted seed. Music and the felt hat are thousands of years away. The sail and the astrolabe, not even specks on the horizon. The window and scissors: inconceivable.\nదాదాపుగా ఇంకా ఏమీ జరగని పురాతన కాలపు మొదటి రోజుల్లో, వ్యవసాయం ఇంకా నాటని విత్తనమే సంగీతమూ, తలపాగాలూ వేలయేళ్ళ తరువాతే తెరచాపలూ, నక్షత్ర యంత్రాలూ దిగంతాల అంచుల్లో కూడా కానరావు కిటికీలు, కత్తెరలూ ఊహించటానికే లేదు\nBut even now, before the orchestra of history has had time to warm up, the first geniuses have found one another and gathered into a thoughtful group. Gaunt, tall and bearded, as you might expect, they stand outlined against a landscape of smoking volcanoes\nఅప్పటికే, చరిత్ర తన కచేరీకి ఇంకా సరిగమలు సర్దుకోకముందే, బుద్ధి కుశలురైన ఆదిమ మేధావులు కొందరు ఒకరినొకరు కలుసుకున్నారు\nపొగలు చిమ్మే అగ్నిపర్వతాల వెలుతురులో ఎత్తుగా, గడ్డాలతో, బక్కచిక్కి, రేఖామాత్రంగా కనిపిస్తున్నారు వాళ్ళు\nor move along the shores of lakes, still leaden and unnamed, or sit on high bare cliffs looking like early arrivals at a party the earth is about to throw now that the dinosaurs have finally cleared the room.\nఒక్కోసారి చిక్కటి, బరువైన, ఇంకా పేర్లు లేని సరస్సుల తీరాల వెంట నడుస్తుంటారు\nఇంకోసారి రాక్షసబల్లులు ఖాళీ చేసి వెళ్లిన గదిలో భూమి ఇంకా మొదలుపెట్టని సంబరాలు చూడటానికి ముందే వచ్చిన వాళ్ళలా ఎత్తైన మొండి కొండచరియల మీద కూర్చుని ఉంటారు.\nThey have yet to discover fire, much less invent the wheel, so they wander a world mostly dark and motionless wondering what to do with their wisdom like young girls wonder what to do with their hair.\nఇంకా నిప్పునే రాజెయ్యలేదు వాళ్ళు చక్రాలూ, బండ్లూ చేసేది ఇప్పుడే కాదు అమ్మాయిలు తమ జుట్టుతో ఏం చేయాలో తోచక సతమతమైనట్టు, ఏమీ కదలిక లేని ఆ చీకటి ప్రపంచంలో తమ జ్ఞానంతో ఏం చేయాలో ఆలోచిస్తూ, ఏమీ తోచనట్లు తిరుగుతూ ఉంటారు వాళ్ళు\nOnce in a while someone will make a pronouncement about the movement of the stars, the density of silence, or the strange behaviour of water in winter, but there is no alphabet, not a drop of ink on earth, so the words disappear into the deep green forests like flocks of small, startled birds.\nఉండీ ఉండీ ఒకళ్ళు నక్షత్రాల కదలికల గురించో, నిశ్శబ్దపు చిక్కదనం గురించో లేదా చలికాలంలో నీళ్ల విచిత్ర ప్రవర్తన గురించో ఒక అభిప్రాయం ప్రకటిస్తారు అప్పటికింకా అక్షరాలు లేవు భూమిమీద ఒక్క చుక్క సిరా లేదు ఎందుకో బెదిరి, ఎగిరి పోయి, దాక్కునే చిన్న పక్షుల గుంపులా ఆ మాటలు, దట్టమైన పచ్చటి అడవుల్లోకి అదృశ్యమై పోతాయి\nEventually one of them will come up with the compass or draw the first number in sand with a stick, and he will let out a shout like Archimedes in his tub and curious animals will look up from their grazing.\nపోగా పోగా ఒకరోజు వాళ్లలో ఒకళ్ళు దిక్సూచిని తయారు చేస్తారు లేదా ఇసుకతో కర్రపుల్లతో మొదటి అంకె గీస్తారు ఆర్కిమెడీస్ తొట్టిలోనుంచి అరిచినట్టుగా అతనొక అరుపు అరుస్తాడు పచ్చిక మేస్తున్న జంతువులు కుతూహలంగా తలలెత్తి చూస్తాయి\nLater the water screw and the catapult will appear; the nail, the speedometer and the bow tie will follow. But until then they can only pace the world gravely, knowing nothing but the thrumming of their minds, not the whereabouts of north or the notion of zero, not even how to sharpen a stone to a deadly point.\nతర్వాత్తర్వాత నీటి యంత్రాలూ, ఒడిసెలలూ వస్తాయి ఆ వెనుకనే మేకులూ, వేగమానినులూ భుజాల మీద కండువాలూ అప్పటిదాకా వాళ్ళు తమ మేధస్సుల ప్రకంపనలు తప్ప ఉత్తర దిక్కు ఎక్కడో, సున్నా అంటే ఏమిటో, కనీసం ఒక రాయిని ములుకుగా పదునుపెట్టటం ఎలాగో, తెలియకుండా, గంభీరంగా, ప్రపంచమంతా తిరగవలసిందే!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Thanks for all the wishes, guys and gals!\n(This was written on 7th November 2018 😊)\nAs I have had a leisurely day and not an overwhelming number of wishes, I have actually been able to reply to most of you individually. 🙂\nWhile replying to a friend with a witty remark, realised that I share my birthday with Albert Camus, who has been my favorite philosopher forever and was encouraged by this fortuitous discovery to re-read his Myth of Sisyphus. Here are a few extracts that made my day! By the way, read in sequence, they kind of capture the essence of the essay too…\n=====\nThere is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. […]\nThis world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. […]\nDoes its absurdity require one to escape it through hope or suicide—this is what must be clarified, hunted down, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest. Does the Absurd dictate death? […]\nLet us insist again on the method: it is a matter of persisting. At a certain point on his path the absurd man is tempted. History is not lacking in either religions or prophets, even without gods. He is asked to leap. All he can reply is that he doesn’t fully understand, that it is not obvious. […]\nSuicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history. His future, his unique and dreadful future—he sees and rushes toward it. In its way, suicide settles the absurd. It engulfs the absurd in the same death. […]\nIf I convince myself that this life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its whole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between my conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I admit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its limited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living but the most living.\nThe most living; in the broadest sense, that rule means nothing. It calls for definition.\nBeing aware of one’ s life, one’ s revolt, one’ s freedom, and to the maximum, is living, and to the maximum. Where lucidity dominates, the scale of values becomes useless.\nThus, it is that no depth, no emotion, no passion, and no sacrifice could render equal in the eyes of the absurd man (even if he wished it so) a conscious life of forty years and a lucidity spread over sixty years.\nThus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion.\nBy the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death—and I refuse suicide."

    "text": "I love multipurpose tools. They are like, so multi purpose. And so handy. And, you know, some times, so discreet.\nFor example, think of that nice nail cutter I had. It had a blade with a small groove (groovy, huh?) that could easily slip the cap off a nice, cold beer bottle. It was always handy and, you know, never any quizzical looks from aged relatives.\nEver since I bought this dedicated bottle opener (wine and beer), it’s always been misplaced. May be missus took it along today to open the bottle of flavored milk for the kid in the break time…can you beat that??\nAnd these door jambs are also useless. You press a flimsy bottle cap in the jamb trying to open it and the door paint starts flaking off. Now, the wood is getting splintered. These house owners are a bunch of thieves, I tell you. No single decent door jamb. I sooo miss my student days and the hostels, at least they had respectable iron doors.\nNone of the handles of the sturdy (sir, it will last a life time…) kitchen appliances worth hundreds of rupees each is up to the task. That stupid tea strainer handle actually bent out of shape….BENT OUT OF SHAPE…..God…!! let me fix that up quick.\nAnd this tooth ache is killing me. At thirty, JUST THIRTY, my teeth are giving up on me. What good is a bunch of teeth if you can’t open a bloody bottle cap, even after getting chipped in the process, I ask you? I will sue that stupid dentist guy. He told me last time that my teeth are in ‘splendid condition’…splendid, #$%&!!\nHmmmm…gulp..gulp…gulp…I looooovvvvvve these big house keys. They might be a bit of a pain to carry around in the pockets of bought-before-the-expansion jeans but when it comes to bottle caps, they work magic.\nAfter a day’s hard work (buying toys for kids IS a cerebrally demanding task), don’t you think a guy is entitled to a couple of sandwiches and a beer?

    "title": "Infibeam Pi: A regular reader’s review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I had been thinking of buying an e-book reader ever since Amazon announced Kindle. So, when Infibeam announced Pi around a year (or more) back, I noticed it immediately. Initially, the only way to buy the device was to look at the pictures and description on the website, trust them and place an order. Unfortunately, I was not that advanced a user of e-commerce. Also, I was secretely waiting for Kindle to come to India. When Kindle finally came to India, the price tag looked prohibitive. I reasoned that I did not anyway have that much time to read books; and may be an e-book reader, priced as much as a netbook, was a little overkill. The irrational reasoning went like this – between Kindle and Pi, I would rather buy Kindle; damn thing is overpriced; I will wait till I can bring myself around to shell out that kind of money; or I will not buy an e-book reader at all.\nThese days, I have quite a lot of time on my hands and as Economics would have it, not too much money. That means I can do justice to an e-book reader in terms of usage and Kindle hopes are dashed due to economic reasons. So, when I saw the Pi in Swapna Bookstore, I was tempted. I came home and tried to get reviews on the web. Very surprisingly, I found none that could help me make up my mind. Some reviews were desultory. Some gave basic facts and a lot of unhelpful details. Some were more like propaganda. None of the reviewers seemed to have spent enough time with the device to be able to take a regular reader’s perspective. I generally went back to the store the next day, took one more look at the device and bought it.\nI have read a dozen (yes, 12) books on the device since and the post purchase dissonance has, hopefully, subsided enough now. Hence, this review. I am going to write about the device in a lot of detail, a significant part of which might look like nitpicking. But what the heck, I spend so much time with it!\nBefore we get in to it, here is the official link – http://www.infibeam.com/Pi it gives a list of specifications and all the standard information. A couple of reviews are also displayed on the page.\nThe Device\n                                                  [![](compare-the-width.jpg&h=225 \"compare the width\")](compare-the-width.jpg)\nCompare the width of the device\n\n\n\nPi - switched off\n\n\nThe Best\nE-ink display: The best thing about the device is it’s E-ink display. The display is very, very pleasing to the eye. It does not strain your eyes at all. There is practically no difference between reading from a page and reading on this screen. One look at the device and you are definitely going to notice this.\nThe Good\nFile formats handled: The device can comfortably handle notepad, MS word, html and pdf files. It can actually handle more file types as listed on the product page but these are the formats I have tried. With some html files, the alignment and line breaks go for a toss and it is impossible (at least for me) to read it but by and large, it handles files well. One great advantage of this is that you need not buy any books. I have a significant number of e-books downloaded from all over the place and I have not yet bought any. (Project Gutenberg is an awesome source of free books).\nThe battery life: Very good. The device actually runs a week if you read about an hour or two per day. You can leave the device on all the time. Charging is quick – about two hours can last you up to two – three days. There is an auto power off option but I do not see the need to use this at all – the device lasts such a long time anyway.\nSoftware and connecting to a computer: There is no complicated software (think of an i-pod here). The device works just like a pen drive when connected to the USB port.\nReading History: The device maintains a reading history where it tracks the books you are reading or you have been reading. Also, it opens each book at the last page you were reading. Some times, this history gets truncated, I am yet to figure out that logic.\nSpace: The device has 512 MB internal memory. If this is not enough for you, there is an SD card slot that can handle 4 GB.\nMusic player: Apparently, there is an option to play music files. I am so indifferent to this that I haven’t tried it yet. Even then, I guess this falls under the good.\nThe Irritating\nScreen flicker: Whenever a page is turned, the screen first goes completely black (yes, not blank) and then the next screen is displayed. This was the biggest cause of the above mentioned post-purchase dissonace for me. I could not get over it for about a day or two. Now, most of the time, I don’t even notice it happens. You get accustomed to it very quickly. Still, it is irritating once in a while. The video below shows the screen flicker towards the end.\nPictures folder: There is no folder organization for pictures. You just dump your pictures wherever you want to on the device and it opens all the picture files in one mega folder. Major problems trying to search out the picture you want or setting a sequence. But then, the device is completely black and white. May be it’s a little too much asking for this.\nThe Bad\nThe scroll button: The button used to turn pages in on the bottom right hand corner. The right edge or the bottom edge of the button need to be pressed to turn a page. The location of the button and it’s working make it nearly impossible to hold in your left hand. And belive me, holding it for a long time in your right hand, especially when reading in bed can get very painful.\nThe audio jack: It’s a 3 mm audio jack. This is, like, outright criminal. One more set of ear phones to trip over.\nHere is a video that shows Pi in operation.\nThe Missing\nSearch function: there is no search function for files. Period. Once you are reading a book, you can search for any words in the book. In the library, there is no search function by name of the file (the why of this has got me beaten). The screen displays only so many titles per page and so, if you have a large folder with let’s say 50 files, you will simply have to manually scroll through the pages to find what you want. Add the fact that there is no path display on the top and it becomes very easy to get lost in a maze of folders.\nAs a last resort, you connect the device to the computer and search the file out. Alternatively, you keep making appropriately named nested folders so that you don’t have to crawl through 50 screens every time you want that particular book – but you still end up clicking through 10 folders. .Anyhow, a ‘path’ display would greatly enhance the usability of the device.\nThe Neglected\nThere are a number of things that are neglected. It’s a decent product, no doubts about it, but certain small things that can potentially enhance the product experience have been neglected.\n\n\n4 buttons on the left spine\n\nTime and date bar: the home screen of the device shows both time and date on two bars. When you are reading a book, the time bar gets hidden and only the date bar is shown on the top. Most of time, when I am reading a book, I am more worried about time than about the date. I guess this would be a small change to make and I hope it is made.\nThe buttons: there are four buttons on the left spine – settings, previous screen, portrait/landscape view switch and one more (I think it is music). These are slightly difficult to access. While we do not need to use the other three buttons as frequently, the ‘previous screen’ button could have been placed in a more accessible position – may some where on the rather empty front panel.\n\n\nfont size buttons on the right spine\n\nCover: The cover is not sold along with the Pi. It is now getting very difficult for me as I start carrying it around. Without a cover, the screen acquires all sorts of smudges. The Swapna Bookstore guys did not have covers when I bought the Pi. It would be a very good idea to sell the cover along with every Pi.\n\n\npower button and SD card slot on the top\n\nMost importantly, A polished, finished look: I don’t know how to say this in better words, but the device lacks a finished, polished look. It looks a little crude and amateurish right now. May be fixing some of the issues discussed above can help; may be some thing else needs to be done about this.\nThe Final Take\nIf you are looking for an e-book reader, Pi is very good. It has a very very good screen, it can handle a large number of file formats and it is quite comfortable to use. If you are in the habit of reading for a couple of hours a day, it can save you a lot of time, money, space and discomfort.\nHaving said that, I feel a little cheated by the product. For a product priced at 10k, there should not have been so many issues that I want to crib about. As they said, I am willing to forgive one serious shortcoming in my friends but a there is a whole lot of them, however small, here. The beauty of it is that I will feel more cheated as they improve the product and keep selling it at the same (or, much worse, a slightly reduced) price. I guess I will just have to live with it."

In this social age, we get to see the innumerable other sides and the lush green grass on each of them…in real time and with perfect clarity. Obviously, it has not always been like this.\nThere was a time when a man was born, lived and died in the same community. He learnt about the life, universe, and everything in it from the community around him. He learnt how to be good, how to live and love. And he would be done learning by the time he was 25, if not sooner.\nThen he lived his life accordingly. His beliefs and his world were in sync and changed slowly enough for them to remain so.\nPeriodically, he would learn of other things, from far away places, about people he could hardly relate to. These did not bother him much as he believed these things were beyond his reach and he was beyond their influence. Occasionally, when he felt something more than that, the people around him reminded it was just the grass being greener on the other side. And the other side was too far to reach.\nToday, thanks to the various information and social products, the other side is never far from your thoughts. Wherever you are, whatever you do and however you live, you always get to see something better, something more productive, something more comfortable. And, here is the key difference, you know that the people on the other side are just like you…you get to see their lives much more closely. Things are no longer in the realm of the unattainable but you don’t have them. If only you had a little more luck, if only you were a little more rich, if you only you worked a little more harder…you are never really happy with yourself.\nAnd you will never be if you just spend time working hard for your career, scrolling Facebook feeds and wishing you were happier."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There was a time when I read books almost without consideration for the subjects. I would pick up any book and generally read. Then started the phase when I had favorites and slowly the things that I read became more and more uniform. I developed an aversion to reading new authors…may be because of all the disappointments or may be because of the unnecessary premium I attached to time. When I came across something interesting in a book shop, I got back home, read the review and then, sometimes, bought the book. One sunday morning, having recognised the fact that in the preceding four months I hadn’t read anything different from what I had always been reading, I set out towards Daryaganj.\nThe mission was to buy books that I hadn’t heard of, based on the book jackets, blurbs and yes, publishers. I actually took a sack (the type in which cement comes packed) and my brother along with me. The harvest in that visit included some real gems like Drop City by TC Boyle, Sunday philosopher’s Club by Alexander McCall smith and so on. There was a lot of useless stuff written by the likes of Tami Hoag, Dale brown and all but then let me not dwell too much on that.\nAmong that books bought that day was this book called ‘Sex, A Mystery’ (SAM) by Fiona Quirina. An unheard of name but it was an imprint of penguin. Apart from the title that was so chicklit-ish, there was a yellow cover and the title was in black type face and comic sans level script…all in all a typical chicklitish novel was what I figured. And then never opened the book.\nThese days I have been a bit jobless and read the book the other day. I was pleasantly surprised by the book, to say the least. It is a well written whodunit. The heroine, Lydia, is a highly qualified (Harvard and MIT) professional, an erstwhile whistle-blower turned to a “sex surrogate”. Her views on male sexuality are at once amusing. I will limit myself to quoting just one here: “I have found out that in a man’s mind future sex is usually more valuable than past sex. This is because future sex is more fertile material for fantasizing; with past sex, a man is stuck with the hard historical facts of a real encounter, always a serious limitation on his imagination. Men, it turns out, are far more romantic than we are; they are always dreaming of something better, sex that is sexier than sex itself”. I was at once reminded of a quote – ‘Most people are not in love with their lover, they are in love with the idea that they are in love’.\nDespite the appearance of the S word so frequently, there are no descriptions of Lydia’s professional encounters. Her profession is dealt with in the same way as it would be if she were, lets say, a waitress. One of her regular clients gets murdered in her bed and there after it proceeds like any other crime story. Lydia shows herself to be an old fashioned heroine with integrity (she refuses to sweep the murder under the carpet), goodness at heart and all the regular virtues.\nHaving said that, Lydia’s profession does give her a certain kind of outlook. This outlook, expressed through intelligent conversation that sometimes sounds insightful (read the part quoted above again), and her light-hearted outlook towards life, makes Lydia a very interesting character. SAM comes across as a good crime novel, with a chocolaty coating of liberal sexuality and consistent humour.\nThere is actually more to the story now. As you can very well see, I liked the way the story was told. The restraint employed in not launching in to graphic descriptions, the consistency of outlook, the persistent refusal to create associations of amorality or immorality with the heroine and so on appeared exemplary and I wanted to read up on the author. The name of the author sounded slightly outlandish and the blurb in the book said “Fiona Quirina is the author of four mysteries and three medical thrillers written under her real name. Fiona’s own life has some remarkable similarities to that of the fictional character, Lydia Quess. Visit her website at lydiaquess.com”.\nTo start with, Google could not find Lydiaquess.com.\nThen I started to look for the author. Here comes the interesting part – there is no trace of a Fiona Quirina or the seven other books she is said to have written. I looked up the copyright page of SAM – it lists the author as “Frederika Quirine Vuyst”. Yeah, you guessed right…no web presence.\nNaturally, I started searching for the book title, the name of the heroine and everything else. There are hundreds of references to this book (by the way, all the reviews/comments said the book was good – may be except this NYT article, generally on chicklit). There are no references or anymore details of the author except for a word by word reproduction of the blurb from SAM.\nWell, a little known, nice story and a mysterious air about who wrote it..what else do you need to feel happy about a book?? I am thrilled."

Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.\nGive your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow."

    "title": "Pennies, Buses and Perspectives",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In three years of my stay in Delhi, I traveled by buses some 6 times. There, I told you the fact; now I will leave you to get judgmental about it.\nThe other day, I had to go to to Gurgaon where a good lunch and some entertaining conversation was promised. I decided to take a bus telling myself that this is a good chance to get a different perspective on Delhi, as I would be leaving the place soon.\nYes, I also wanted to save the 600 bucks or so that I would have had to spend if I took a cab. While on saving pennies, my favorite penny-phrase had been ‘penny pincher’ with the right amount of disdain. And the favorite penny quote used to be “penny wise pound foolish” implying that all penny pinching is useless. Ever since the newly acquired jobless status, my favorite penny quote changed to “a penny saved is a penny less to be earned”.\nAnyway, this is all about the different perspectives gained in the travel-to-Gurgaon-in-a-bus process. Here we go:\nThe same streets look different when you travel in a bus. Since you are seated higher in a bus, there is actually a physically different perspective.\nOne gets to be more aware of the surroundings. You get about two seconds to jump out of a bus on a corner if you realize in time that the bus is going left where as you want to go right. Well, this happens primarily because you don’t know anything about bus routes. Therefore, this observation might not apply to people who are more exposed to the intricacies of the said subject.\nThe aurobindo ashram herbal garden that you always thought of visiting is a triangular patch of land overgrown with clearly identifiable weeds. You definitely can’t see this unless you are in a bus.\nThe ‘machine ka thanda pani 50 p’ carts are no anachronisms. When there is no one selling bottled water within a kilometer either way, the ‘MCD south zone 2/15’ written in flaky paint on the ‘machine’ is the only thing that lets you rationalize that there is some sort of MCD registration that this guy has. Thereafter, buying a glass of water is not too far away on the perspectives path, especially since you don’t want to die of thirst.\nIn unfamiliar environs, the building you want to go to is generally right after a bus stop. By the time you spot the building, the bus is past. The next stop is at least a kilometer away.\nIf you walked back to the building you wanted to go, then walked a couple of kilometers to the lunch venue and if you are wearing a jeans and t-shirt in to a building full of people wearing business formals, you might want to wait outside till your hosts turn up. Otherwise, the reservation desk guy might ask you if you are going inside for the “thandi hawa”. Even if you give a cold, haughty look and walk past that guy, it might come back to haunt you if you discover five minutes later that you are in the wrong joint. The reservation desk guy will have the last laugh/sneer even as you might console yourself with the fact that the ignoramus doesn’t know you are going to the hipper place down the corridor.\nWhen you start walking back to the bus stop a couple of kilometers away after a satisfying lunch, there are moments when you curse the heat, yourself, the pennies you are trying to pinch and almost pull out your cell phone to call for a cab. At this juncture, if you look around, you might find the middle aged woman bringing a heavy hammer down on an old, rusted iron cylinder repeatedly. If you look closer, you might see that she is trying to take the hardened concrete out of the cylinder, no doubt with an intent to sell the iron for scrap. Now is the time to exercise your legendary analytical skills and try to work out the cost-benefit of her actions. The result might, just might, persuade you to try walking that one kilometer.\nA ride from Gurgaon to Delhi in a Skoda Fabia costs Rs. 20. You just stand on the road and hope that a Fabia ,with a professional driver (as opposed to a guy driving his own car) in it, turns up.\nWell, even considering that there were no spirits at the lunch, it was good and the conversation was entertaining as expected (thanks, guys!). And as you can see, valuable perspectives were gained, documented and dispatched."

    "title": "Book Review – Krishnavatara",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Like most Indians, I can also claim to have grown up listening to stories of Rama and Krishna – Lord Rama, the upholder of human virtue, the unflinching hero who stood for what he thought was right and Lord Krishna, the opportunist, who did whatever was needed to get what he wanted in the end. It is said of them that Rama spent his life telling people he is no god while everyone around revered him and Krishna spent his life trying to convince everyone he is a god while people found it difficult to trust him.\nOn the face of it, Rama seems to be guided by a set of rather uncomplicated values, following them uncompromisingly. On the other hand, Krishna is an enigma – he is a butter thief, a consummate lover, a devoted husband, a crafty politician, a kingmaker and finally the supreme teacher of Bhagavad Gita…all in one life time. One is naturally left wondering what kind of a being he could have been.\nK.M. Munshi’s book Krishnavatara does a beautiful job of capturing this wonderment. Munshi clarifies his approach to the story of Krishna right at the beginning: this is not a retelling of any of the puranas or any other book but the story of Krishna as he knew of Him. Munshi then goes on to write about the man whose life could have been the basis of the legend we know today as Lord Krishna. While remaining largely faithful to the story line of Mahabharata and Bhagavata, the author uses his fertile imagination to romanticize the tale by taking out all the ‘miracles’ and replacing them with rational events.\nTo start with, Munshi carefully sets the social scenario using the characters of Sage Parashara (Veda Vyasa’s father) and other rishis. Aryaavarta (as India was referred to then) is descending in to lawlessness. People are losing respect for the Arya Dharma. On the political front, the mighty Kuru Empire is crumbling but for the presence of the ageing warrior Bhishma. King Drupada of Panchala refuses an alliance with Kuru’s due to his feud with Drona, the warrior-priest of the Kuru Empire. The rising might of Chakravartin Jarasandha, aided by his tyrannical son-in-law Kamsa, is a threat to the Aryan way of life. The whole of Aryaavarta seems destined to be gobbled up by Jarasandha.\nKrishna Vaasudeva is the teenage son of a lesser prince of Yadavas, brought up as a cowherd. He gets catapulted in to this political arena when he kills his maternal uncle Kamsa to fulfill an age old prophecy. Jarasandha promptly declares war on Mathura. Yadavas are marked for destruction even while celebrating their savior. They are a weakened race, broken in spirit by the tyrannical ruler Kamsa. The political pundits of the day write off Yadavas and their teenage upstart savior.\nBut then the young cowherd surprises the world by starting to call the shots. Faced with the wrath of the Emperor, he refuses the throne of Mathura and the offer of Yadavas to die defending him. Instead, he goes on the run, reaches an impregnable hill and befriends the local tribe called Garudas. Jarasandha starts in pursuit treating it as a mere rabbit hunt. Aided by the Garudas, Krishna and Balarama hand him an ignominious defeat in a surprise night attack. The rise of a military genius gets recognized by the world.\nFrom then on Munshi tracks the political fortunes of Krishna as he leads Yadavas to Dwaraka, forges a formidable kingdom and then goes on to play the kingmaker in the Aryavarta. All the while, Krishna firmly proclaims the one force that keeps him going – a strong desire to see Dharma triumph. At each point of his life, every decision he makes – whether deciding to kill Kamsa or abducting Rukmini or refusing Draupadi’s hand and even the decision to support Pandavas in preference to the Kauravas – is made with that single principle in mind. Lord Krishna still remains an enigma, due to his uncanny ability to see his Dharma clearly even when everyone around him gets confounded by the complication of it all.\nAt different times during the story, the author brings out the multiple facets of His great personality – a master strategist (engineering Draupadi swayamvara), an insightful leader (uniting Yadavas in to a formidable force), an unparalleled diplomat (avoiding a full scale war with Jarasandha) and above all, a compassionate human being. Munshi leaves the reader in complete awe and reverence for the great human being behind the god that we know of and, as a matter of fact, ignore.\nThe easily understandable language employed by Munshi makes it a good reading for young readers too (I read the book for the first time when I was 14). The use of archaic, anglicized Sanskrit words in places can be a little off putting but that has its own charm. The only regrettable thing is that Kulapati Munshi could only complete 7 volumes of the book, the 7th one ending with the banishment of Pandavas after the game of magical dice. He passed away leaving the 8th volume, The book of Kurukshetra, incomplete.\nThe book : Krishnavatara in eight volumes – The Magic Flute, The Wrath of an Emperor, The Five Brothers, The Book of Bhima, The Book of Satyabhama, The Book of Vedavyaasa – The Master, The Book of Yudhishthira, The Book of Kurukshetra (incomplete) published by Bhavan’s Book University (1970).\nThe author: K.M. Munshi (1887 – 1971) was an eminent lawyer, a freedom fighter, a member of the constitution drafting committee, and a seasoned statesman. He worked with Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Tilak, Annie Besant, Jinnah and others during the freedom struggle. He was the Home Minister of Bombay, India’s Food Minister, Governor of Uttar Pradesh and India’s Agent General at Hyderabad. He was also acknowledged as the foremost writer in Gujarati in his times, having written novels, dramas, memoirs, history and historical novels in Gujarati and English. He was also the founder director of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, for which he is titled ‘Kulapati’."

    "text": "We wanted to buy a helmet for the kid. A week went by in making sure that no helmet shop in and around my place has one. Then we spied a kid with a helmet. While I was quietly trying to get the helmet off him, missus quickly asked the mother where they bought it. The lady said that there is a large helmet market in JC road. And the missus promptly despatched me on the mission today morning.\nThe first shop I went to had a helmet in white. I closed my eyes, tried to imagine my kid in a white helmet and was not entirely satisfied with the result. I said I wanted one in red or black. The salesman said they did not have one. End of story. I was walking out when the shop owner, for some reason, looked up and saw me walking out without a helmet in hand. I guess he wanted to do his good deed for the day. He caught hold of me and said he would get the helmet for me, in ten minutes. I decided to wait. Yeah, and spent an hour waiting.\nI got the helmet finally but this post is about the hour I spent in the helmet market on JC road. What did I do for such a long time without a book in hand? How did I stop myself from going mad or driving everyone else mad? Why did I even wait an hour there? One day I shall get it to the silver screen but for now, I will simply write it out for you.\nOnce I figured that the “ten minutes” the shop owner wanted was actually a (much longer) period of time scaled down to fit the estimated breadth of my patience; and that I was not going to have any luck in figuring out the scale conversion chart, I promptly stepped out and saw this scene. Here, you tell me what you see in it.\n\n This is what I saw outside \nRoad? Autos? Shops? And do you notice that red circle filled in red that I have so cleverly placed on a shop? I doubt you would have noticed the shop even if you were with me, but my well-trained eye did not miss the heap of onion samosas in the shop. I darted across and when I asked for two samosas, he gave me two pieces wrapped in separate pieces of paper. That’s when I realised that the standard portion there is one samosa and one tea. The samosas were awesome and he had a real heap of them and was still making more. It is apparantly a favorite place with autowallahs. I took some photos to put here like the good guy I am.\n\n\n The ingredients are rather simple \n\n The frying process \n The final products are tempting! \nI thoroughly enjoyed myself and when I looked up, across the streeet, there was an old fashioned white-on-dark-blue board (do you remember the erstwhile higginbothams boards in railway stations?) that proclaimed in kannada “Nandeeshwara lunch home”. It is apparantly a ‘Brahmana’ lunch home run by a ‘Krishna Madhyastha’. I was already feeling bad that it was neither snack time nor lunch time and that I would not be able to sample anything in that place, when I spied the world-famous-in-Bangalore MTR outlet across the street.\nIt is such an unassuming place that I would have missed it completely despite having heard so much about it. The place apparantly opens after 12.30 pm for lunch and so was closed at the time I was there. I noticed a sweets counter and walked in. Since I was not very sure of getting the helmet, I thought I would hedge my chances by buying some sweets for the missus. There was jalebi, which is a favorite with the missus. In my eagerness to get it correct, I asked the helpful looking person behind the counter – “Is this made in oil or ghee?”. The answer- “ghee” – came packed in a blood curdling chillness. A moments’ thought and realisation dawned. It’s a very very serious mistake to make in an established sweet shop in South India. Proud shop owners and shop assistants can not even stand the thought of the existence of such a doubt. I promptly set about buying five different varieties, which led to a little warming up all around.\nBy the time I went back to the shop, a helmet in shining gray color was ready and I even got a thirty rupee discount since I waited for an hour.\nThe sweets are nice, I now know where the MTR eatery is, and my kid likes the helmet. And my urge to learn something everyday was satisfied when I figured that MTR stands for Mavalli Tiffin Rooms. Bet you didn’t know that!!"

So, the idea of work has been on my mind and here is a collection of “work quotes” from IIMBaba’s teachings and discourses over the years. You know where that preachy tone comes from.\n“******Work is like a python – when you are in its clutches, if you continue to stare at it mesmerized, it will slowly crush you. The trick is to get out of its grip, a little at a time******”\n(Same approach works for depression, too)\n“Why do you want work life balance? They should not be weighed in the same scales at all”\n“If you think the feeling you get when there is a lot of work waiting for you is bad, wait till the time when all that is waiting for you is non-work*”\n“Are you one of those who say they will be happy if only they can make a living out of doing whatever they think they like doing? Nothing can be far from the truth. By making your pleasure your work, instead of making work more palatable, you are going to make the pleasure much less pleasurable. It’s the label “work” that makes it painful, not what it is”\n“Why do you want your work to be ‘meaningful’ and ‘fulfilling’? It’s your life which is supposed to have these attributes. Stop expecting salvation through work. Treat it as the small part of life that it is. At 30, work does look like a large part of life, just like sex looked like a large part of marriage when you were 25 (or 20 or 18 depending on when you started contemplating marriage). Out grow this work dependence, start living life”\nThere. Now that you have been suitably enlightened, please get back to work.\n*Non-work: work like things done in offices around the world when there is no work."

    "text": "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. […]\nThis world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. […]\nDoes its absurdity require one to escape it through hope or suicide—this is what must be clarified, hunted down, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest. Does the Absurd dictate death? […]\nLet us insist again on the method: it is a matter of persisting. At a certain point on his path the absurd man is tempted. History is not lacking in either religions or prophets, even without gods. He is asked to leap. All he can reply is that he doesn’t fully understand, that it is not obvious. […]\nSuicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history. His future, his unique and dreadful future—he sees and rushes toward it. In its way, suicide settles the absurd. It engulfs the absurd in the same death. […]\nIf I convince myself that this life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its whole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between my conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I admit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its limited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living but the most living. […]\nThe most living; in the broadest sense, that rule means nothing. It calls for definition. […]\nBeing aware of one’ s life, one’ s revolt, one’ s freedom, and to the maximum, is living, and to the maximum. Where lucidity dominates, the scale of values becomes useless. […]\nThus, it is that no depth, no emotion, no passion, and no sacrifice could render equal in the eyes of the absurd man (even if he wished it so) a conscious life of forty years and a lucidity spread over sixty years. […]\nThus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. […]\nBy the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death—and I refuse suicide. […]\nI leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one’s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

    "text": "I am learning sociology along with our girl who is in 12th grade. We have an enthusiastic sociology major setting us up with videos and readings, we come prepared with notes and then there is an hour-long discussion every week. We also spend an hour or more internally, discussing the ideas and thoughts. The following note comes as a reflection from a few of these classes. And yes, this is not my first brush with sociology.\nOne of the things I like about sociology is how it deals with the limitations of the approach up-front. The existence of deep seated biases and prejudices we bring to work as human sociologists, is highlighted and the definition of sociological perspective incorporates the existence of these human limitations. Sociology also acknowledges the limits to its explanatory powers, rather explicitly.\nThis is unlike science, which does not highlight these limitations. As a rule, every discipline kind of overstates it’s own explanatory powers, but science as we learnt it, definitely takes the cake. Science presents itself as the explainer of all things in the universe whereas it is not.\nScientific method is awesome and cool but when we attribute the objectivity of the scientific method to our own process of reasoning, and start behaving like since we are using reason and rationality as a tool, what we arrive at is true and it is the only truth, is when the approach stops being useful.\nGiven that most of us are from the couple of generations that venerated science and trivialised social sciences, there is no dearth of people who go about making observations, using logic and reasoning to make conclusions and go around behaving like they have arrived at the truth, all the while unaware of how the lack of sociological and psychological perspective limits the utility of their reasoning very severely.\nSo, please learn a little bit of formal sociology and psychology before you go about commenting on social issues. You will only be helping yourself."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A cousin of ours asked this question today, for her 1 year and 7 month old child. The child seems to have learnt numbers 1 to 10 on her own!\nPlease note how she prefaces the question – she already knows what we think of teaching alphabet and numbers to very young children. And that we adore this child.  Our answer is below. We share this so that someone who knows better can correct us if we got something wrong, and may be someone will learn from this.\nQuestion: I know you don’t appreciate this question much, but I have to ask “which is a better way to teach the alphabet, with letter names or sounds” ?\n Chitra: Very difficult question…May be you want to teach her other things first. Labeling – nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions; Visual skills – matching pictures, objects, recognising these two are one. Then matching things that go together, then sorting and categorising (children need not have the vocabulary for this. It’s intuitive. We can provide vocabulary when they group). All these are pre-number, pre-reading skills. Let the child engage in these activities in context, for example when you are sorting vegetables.\nVenu: What chitra is saying is – do some of these instead of the alphabet. Visual matching, categorising and sorting are the basic cognitive skills that children anyway use to process what they see around them. That’s how we all “learn about the world”. It would be good for her to do this in context, while she engages with a real world task.\nWriting is a very specific way of encoding information and reading is a very specialised skill, if you look at it that way. Reading as a way of acquiring information, is a very “limiting” skill, in the sense that once you figure reading is a way to acquire information, you stop looking for information through other approaches like doing it yourself. Children should be left to explore the world a little longer, I feel.\nUnfortunately, since reading requires only the ability to see and the ability to make sounds, and does not require eye hand coordination or other motor skills that may be needed for children to engage more with the kind of hands-on activities we are able to offer them in confined spaces like our homes and apartments, they are getting introduced to alphabet earlier. It doesn’t also help that there is a lot of premium attached to reading and this behavior gets highly reinforced.\nWe should encourage the child engage daily with a plant, earth, water, flour, pasta etc. natural things than with the alphabet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "EXPLICIT CONTENT WARNING, if you haven’t figured it out already! 🙂\nOn February 21, 2011, Michael Bailey, a tenured professor at the Northwestern University, who teaches an undergraduate course in “Human Sexuality” arranged an after-class activity for his class of 600 students. esquire reports “Bailey had invited two rather enthusiastic local couples to talk at an after-class discussion about “networking for kinky people.” When they came into Ryan Auditorium, the students were finishing an educational video that questioned the existence of the female G-spot, which is, somehow, a scientifically controversial subject these days. The guests wanted to assure everyone otherwise and asked Bailey if they could perform a little demonstration. He hesitated only briefly — maybe too briefly — before saying yes. But putting a condom on a banana this was not: After some warnings about the graphic nature of what they were going to see, the students watched a man pull out a motorized dildo — otherwise known as a “fucksaw” — and bring a woman to orgasm on stage.” Another account reports – “The professor alerted his students about this extraordinary show-and-tell session, and made clear that attendance was voluntary. The standard account has it that 120 or so of the 622 students enrolled in the course showed up.”\nA complete waste of time for everyone is what I think it is. Here is a rather ritualistic commentary on the issue (yeah, finding such things and then writing righteous blog posts is a ritual of sorts).\nNow, the point of this post: Joseph Epstein, Professor Emeritus at Northwestern, wrote this fantastic piece in the weekly Standard (got it via Briggs). Idiocy of Bailey and his ilk is, sometimes, pardonable for the quality of the comments it generates. That reminds me of this letter written by Rohinton Mistry in the “book banning” controversy spearheaded by the scion of Shiv Sena. Unfortunately, in this case, there is no excuse for the young Thackeray."

    "text": "I was once sharing rooms with a friend who did not eat eggs.\nRight. That’s what I remember him for – not eating eggs.\nI can hear you wondering – “What is so great about it? A lot of people do not eat eggs”. His not eating eggs was different since he ate everything else – chicken, mutton and fish; possibly even beef and pork. May be not dog. But never ate eggs.\nIt came out fairly early in my acquaintance with him. One evening we were out searching for food. We were not hungry enough to eat anything seriously non-vegetarian but wanted something spicy. I suggested egg biriyani. And pat came the reply – “I don’t eat eggs. Don’t ask me why.” I let it pass since I did not know him well enough. But the seed of the question that would haunt me later was planted in my head.\nI eat eggs every day, at least with one meal. Every time, I offered to make him some eggs and every time he refused. He would simply say “No”. He continued saying no to eggs even after he realized I was (I still am) a good cook. I was intrigued.\nI initially wondered about how different he was in other respects – you know, skeletons in the closet kind of thing. And he kept his room door locked all the time. But as I slowly got to know him, I realized he was more or less a normal human being in all other aspects, except for not eating eggs.\nIt became a constant thought with me. We would be sitting, watching TV together and I would suddenly look at him and wonder – “why doesn’t he eat eggs”? Or we would be taking a walk, there would be a lull in the conversation and eggs would pop in to my head.\nI started thinking more and more about it. I still did not know him well enough to press him for an answer. Maybe he thought of an egg in terms of the life it contains and possibly did not want to end a life not yet began. So, with my usual astuteness, I once led him to a discussion on “what came first – chicken or egg”. He did not show any pro-egg sentiment throughout the one hour discussion. On another day, while cleaning the house, I noticed a nest of lizard eggs and covertly watched to see what he would do, half-expecting him to start coochi-cooing to them. He just gathered them up and put them in the dustbin. No – it was just not a pro-life approach. But still he would not eat eggs.\nMay be his family was in to chicken farming and he had grown sick of eating eggs everyday for the first 15 years of his life. A careful background check revealed that his father was a banker. No way.\nAnother day, I fell asleep while watching a Hindi movie and had a dream. In that dream, my friend was a child of ten. His parents shut him up in a cellar by mistake and left for a long holiday. For fifteen days, he was stuck in the cellar with a large carton of eggs. Raw egg for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That would turn any one permanently off eggs. When I probed around his childhood, I discovered that he grew up in the middle of Delhi, in an apartment complex. That theory went out of the window.\nIn another scenario I thought of, my friend had a chicken as a pet and was very close to it. He might have seen, up close, how hard it was to actually lay an egg. Think of one good friend you care about. Now imagine a fully inflated football coming out of his behind, one every day. And then imagine that is the only way of producing footballs – would you do anything that increases the demand for footballs? You wouldn’t. On careful thought, I let this go since you wouldn’t eat your friend either. My friend has no problems eating a full chicken for lunch.\nI was once rifling through his bookshelf and realized that there was a definite socialist, possibly even communist, slant to his reading. Then I recalled that there are two types of chicken – broilers and layers. Broilers are eaten and layers lay eggs. Was there a class struggle angle? Did he think of layers as the bourgeois middle class and did not want to have anything to do with them? Or did he see them as the worker class and does not want to participate in the ‘cruel exploitation’? Did he harbor the dream of bringing freedom and power to the exploited classes of chicken world? Again, obliquely approaching it through a high sounding intellectual discussion, I was disappointed to discover that he did not even know there are different classes of chicken. I also discovered, by some tactful questioning, that he had never been to a chicken farm in life.\nOne Sunday morning, we had a ‘pure vegetarian’ friend visiting. While I was preparing bread and eggs for my breakfast, he looked at the eggs distastefully and had the gall to say that eggs stink. I had never thought of it that way – eggs smell delicious! Then it struck me. Maybe that is the reason my friend did not eat eggs. The next day I bought some dried fish and fried them while he was around. They stank so much I had to hold my nose while he was not looking. He was happily standing around offering random suggestions and ate a large share when it was done. So, it was not smell.\nBy this time my stay in the city was coming to an end. We never grew any closer – maybe he was generally the reserved sort. Or maybe I put him off with my persistent probing, though I swear I was quite discreet and tactful. Anyway, I could never ask him directly and I never found out why he didn’t eat eggs.\nOnce in a while I still visit him when I travel to the city. He still does not eat eggs. May be he simply does not like the taste of them. Maybe he has an allergic reaction to something in eggs. Or maybe he was once bombed by alien chicken with their exploding eggs and has a permanent fear of eggs. I wouldn’t know."

    "text": "AK – Ayyappanum Koshiyum, is about a chance encounter between a police officer (Ayyappan) and an influential, rich, ex-serviceman brat (Koshy) and the aftermath where they go head to head, hell bent on destroying each other. And the movie is anything but what you expect from the summary above, especially if you are accustomed to Telugu and Tamil movies.\nThe characters are human, richly portrayed, people and the settings are natural, if somewhat rural. The story is gripping and visuals are used effectively to convey a lot of nuance. Especially the scene where A and K are in the police station for the first time and K threatens to just walk away and disappear. Dialogues are sparse and meaningful.\nOne of our favorite scenes is the one where A and his wife Kannamma are sitting under the tree next to their house. The last dialogue was A saying to her, “you have never done what I have asked you to do and neither have I”. Look for it and the subtext it conveys when you watch the movie. Kannamma and her feistiness, is like that extra bit of detail an artist adds on to enhance the beauty of the art work, and for no other reason.\n I know that I don’t know how to write a movie review, I don’t watch too many, nor do I read or write reviews frequently. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the 3 hours (yes, it was that long) and I recommend it highly.\nIt’s in Malayalam with English subtitles, on Prime video. Again, you don’t feel like you are watching a foreign language movie, even if you don’t know Malayalam. For those who are not familiar, Malayalam is a mellow sounding language with lots of Sanskrit like words that you can catch easily if you pay a little bit of attention.\nHave fun!"

    "text": "For sometime now, I have been thinking of the UID scheme and wondering why the negative side of the system has not been getting any attention, while there seems to be a lot of euphoria around the scheme (Gulzar’s articles on UID, for example). May be I did not look hard enough, but there has been very little debate on the issue, at least in the mainstream media.\nThere are some serious issues involved: issues like invasion of privacy and huge cost of the scheme. A more worrying prospect is the of misuse of information and the lack of any meaningful laws to prevent the same. If you think misuse of personal information is limited to e-mail and facebook hacking, think of the way riots in ‘shining’ modern India are organised around voter list print-outs. One more issue is that all this information is going to be available to a significant number of bureaucrats – people who are notorious for complicity in government backed crimes.\nToday I found this article on Forbes India Business, that talks about some of these issues. I hope the dissenting voices get heard. But then, these voices got picked up by Forbes is no reason to hope that the debate would become mainstream.\nWhat do I mean by that? I am just thinking about the length of time it took for the Radia tapes to break into headlines, even after the transcripts were put on the web."

Actually, (and here I speak with the benefit of an immense amount of hind sight), Time is much much more valuable than Money. The time you did not spend living your life cannot be brought back. It certainly cannot be bought back with any amount of money you could possibly make. Use your time living life the way you want.

    "text": "The other day we went to visit an uncle in Dwaraka. He lives in a well maintained housing society- open lawn inside, silent generators, ground floor dedicated to parking and the works. The lawn is located in the center of the society. The seven towers, each with seven stories, are arranged around the lawn so that each tower has a view of the lawn.\nThe weather that evening was very nice. Dark clouds were gathering from one side. The sun was still shining on the other side. The buildings were very brightly lit against the dark background of clouds and were looking brand new. The greenery around had taken different hues due to the contrasting lighting and background. It looked like an indoor setting for a movie about summer showers. The breeze was cool and rain was in the air.\nAfter some time, I was getting tired of the view. Just then I noticed a small girl on the opposite balcony. She had a big mushroom of hair. She was dancing and the mushroom was flaring. It started to drizzle and a big brother came out with a multi-colored umbrella. Soon the umbrella started twirling in to a rainbow.\nSlowly I started to notice more and more people on the balconies. Not all of them were as visible as the girl and the umbrella. Not too many of them were carrying rainbows. There was this well lit balcony and till I noticed the lone guy sitting in the shadows, I thought it was empty. He looked old to me. On a top floor balcony two young men and a woman were sitting around in cane chairs, having tea. A kurta clad middle aged paunch was rocking on a third floor. A shapely, track suited girl was looking down from a seventh floor window. A small girl was jumping in to every puddle in the parking lot and her youngish parents were walking behind her leisurely. The lady in the adjacent fifth floor balcony had been on the phone all the while, unmindful of the view or the weather. In a half-lit kitchen, a maid was cooking away.\nThe rain started to beat down in a steady drone. Most people were moving back indoors and the light was fading in to darkness\nFor some strange reason, I suddenly thought of a zoo."
