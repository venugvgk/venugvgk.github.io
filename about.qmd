# Profile Summary

I am an educator, teaching coach, writer and a nonprofit leader, dedicated to transforming education through inclusion, empathy, and learner-centered practices. Drawing from diverse background in engineering, management, and education, as well as personal experience as a parent of a child with autism, I champion the rights of neurodivergent learners and promote holistic, context-sensitive approaches to education for everyone. 

I am a strong advocate for neurodiversity, inclusive education, and non-standardized learning. I believe we need to create and promote accessible alternatives to test-driven systems, emphasizing emotional development, autonomy, and real-world engagement. 

Currently, I lead [Farm Hill Education Trust](https://farmhill.in) (FHT), a non-profit working in the areas of education, neurodiversity and community. Through FHT, we run [Subodha Learning Community](https://subodha.farmhill.in), a homeschool support center and [Sambhavam Center for Autism](https://sambhavam-autism.com), an early intervention center, in Bangalore. We also run [Farm Hill Learning](https://farmhill-learning.org), a neurodiverse, close to nature learning community, near Hosur. 

I write and translate children's literature in Telugu and English. I also write educational content promoting empathy, inclusion, and educational reform.

I envision a world where education systems celebrate diversity and uphold the dignity of every learner. My work aims to create safe, affirming spaces for children often underserved by mainstream models, paving the way for more compassionate and effective approaches to learning.

Formerly, I was lecturer in electrical engineering, a management consultant and an ed-tech product manager. I have an MBA from IIM Bangalore and I am currently (2024-26) pursuing an M.A. in Education at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) with a focus on philosophy and sociology of education.
