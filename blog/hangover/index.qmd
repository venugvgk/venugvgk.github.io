title: Hangover
---

A bewitching sea beckons

 Red, white, maroon, gold

 Sweet, sour, pungent and bitter

<br>

 A short plunge and a large gulp

 Seeking, searching

 Diving in, coming up

 A breath of air, a sip of water

 Heading back, hitting the bottom

<br>

 Lost and spent, I float up with the dawn

 A couple of rough gems

 One or two rounded pearls

 Slithering stones and stinking mud

<br>

 And a million glittering pieces

 Of fact, fiction and fantasy

 Sticking to my skin, drying in the sun

 Some I brush away

 Like sand from the beach

 Some are etched deeper

 Shining tattoos to talk about

 For a couple of weeks

<br>

 Then there are those…

 Larger and sharper

 Digging deep, in to skin and psyche

 Bleeding and healing

 As I head down again

<br>

 Seeking, searching, probing…
