And then said **IIMBaba** (Registered trademark): “Bhakta, there is nothing called freedom. You live your life in a set of nested cages. As soon as you break free from one, you become aware of the existence of the next”.

 When Bhakta looked completely crestfallen, Baba, uncharacteristically, took pity and continued “Do not lose hope. Keep going at them and who knows…you might one day break open the last, if such a thing exists”.
