title: Watching Wild Wild Country
---

1\. First thing I noted was how similar the body language and diction of some of the modern gurus, especially Ravi shankar is to that of Rajneesh.

 <br>
2\. In the first two epoisodes, I was stuck by how the narrative was completely driven from the point of view of Rajneeshees but was aware of this as a plot device.

3\. It was also intriguing to know involvement of Nike cofounder in this. And that there is a lot of influence peddling, from Antelope. How else can a community of 40 people stand up to a corporation the size and influence of Rajaneesh?

 <br>
4\. And the fear of the unknown and the kind of religious blasphemy that Rajaneeshees presented to the locals.

 <br>
5\.  From part 2 onwards, it was clear to see that despite their positions within a very influential cult that has so many followers, neither Sheela nor Niren really understood how to influence public opinion. They are arrogant and turn everyone against themselves.

 <br>
6\. In E3, I was stuck by their callousness in recruiting the homeless street people to their project and the choosing to sedate and abandon them once they prove to be no longer useful.

 <br>
7\. In E4, the internal politics of a closely run group and how they can influence what happens are shown beautifully.

 <br>
8\. In E5 and parts of E6, the entire blame is shifted to Sheela. While the group close to her is mentioned repeatedly, she is presented as the king pin. Even Jane gets a pass.

 <br>
9\. Sheela remains without empathy. Her language, her thinking and all justify the bad light she is shown in.

 <br>
10\. Surprisingly, Rajaneesh is also shown to be more or less out of this loop. If mountains of evidence was collected, and seeing how actively he engages and responds after sheela left, isnt it surprising his role is not focused on?

 <br>
11\. The continuing affiliation of Niren with Rajaneeshees? Does it continue?<br>
12\. Is it an attempt by the rajaneeshees to clear Osho’s name? Is this in lieu of the book he asked Niren to write?
