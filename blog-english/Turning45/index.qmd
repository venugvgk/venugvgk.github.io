Yes, that was today. Here are the gifts I got.

1. This is me according to Srikar. The note that came with it made me proud. 
"Proudly, with his back turned upon the Infinite Demon, he stands with head held high. In his hand a power beyond kings, in his heart a knowledge beyond knowing, he is unstoppable in all ways."
