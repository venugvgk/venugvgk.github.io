title: 'Babaspeak: Rebels'
---

Bhakta, returning from another painful session of an organizational development effort, asked IIMBaba – “Baba, why don’t these people who call themselves ‘rebels’ simply quit the system?”

 Baba answered patiently, albeit obliquely – “While there can be any number of reasons (and I am sure you will find the most\-noble\-sounding of them thrown about if you go around asking), I favor the simplest of them all. All of us need an ostensibly oppressive system to rebel against. Being in charge of one’s own destiny, if you think about it, is very inconvenient.”

 Bhakta, thanks to what is now quite some years of practice, managed to ignore the lurking suspicion that there was a lesson intended for him in Baba’s reply.
