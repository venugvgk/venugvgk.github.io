title: 'Babaspeak: Equanimity'
---

Senior Bhakta came to IIMBaba in a state of ecstasy and said ”My boss told me today after an HR team meeting that he admires me for my willingness to talk straight”

 IIMbaba thought: “Could it have been reflected self\-admiration on part of your boss? but going by the way he put his thoughts, he does not appear as tactless a blunderer as you are” and immediately felt the typically inexplicable self\-consciousness that passes over in a flash.

 His discourse that day was on equanimity and it’s virtues.
