title: Expectations and Relationships
---

It is not that one cannot have expectations in a relationship. It is that if one is so attached to the expectations, to the extent that the relationship is dependent on the expectations being met, and will not survive when those are not met, then is it a relationship between two people, or a relationship between oneself and oneâ€™s expectations?
