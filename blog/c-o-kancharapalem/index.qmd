title: C/o Kancharapalem
---

I rarely write about movies. Actually, Chitra and I watch movies rarely. The last one we watched together in a theatre was kahani in 2012\. Yes, that rarely. And kahani came 8 years after the previous one.

 C/o kancharapalem was an experience worth that kind of wait. Starting from the opening credits song to the unexpected, yet strangely quietening, climax, it was riveting.

 ![](https://venugvgk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/images.jpeg?w=258) What we noticed first was the costumes,  the setting and the language, which were as authentic as the kallapi smell we grew up with. Then we noticed the performances were not at all canned or practiced and that’s what made them endearing. I remember having thought either these are all new actors or they are so good that they manage to ‘act’ like they are new to acting. Later I found from the internet that all but one of the actors are locals from the village. The team behind this must have had a very clear direction and vision to get such compelling performances from absolutely new people.

 All of this vanished quickly from the mind as we were pulled into the story. The key characters are established quickly with bold strokes. There are no back stories, no annoying “narrator” trying to set the “tone”. We recognised so many of the incidents and characters – girls going around on bicycles, boys following them to and from home, uncles beating up romeos,  bakery “parties” with veg puffs and cool drinks, pink color lyrics books…and the emotions – as chitra said in the interval – we felt strange with so many memories and emotions swirling around.

 We also noticed and absolutely loved the lack of “fair”ness. Chitra said – “I wish there were more such movies with such people in them when I was growing up”. I am sure there would more than one dusky beauty thinking the same, watching this movie.

 In the “second\-aaff” the movie gets a little heavy but quickly moves on, warms up and turns out a heart warming, spirit lifting, hope filling, end.

 While I am thinking about it, there have been many movies that used realistic story telling but most of them are the dark and brooding variety. There have been movies that evoked nostalgia (‘naa autograph’ comes to mind) but this story is so much more authentic.

 On a more autobiographical note, my bhargavi married her Joseph, so there will be no Radha\-Raju to continue the story. But that’s also an occasion to think of the of the various “sunitha’s” in my life this morning and that fills my heart with happiness. If you don’t get this, go watch the movie ☺️

 Overall, the charm of the movie, for us, was that it showed us – reminded us – the life we lived and the loves we loved. What a movie!!

 Thank you devulapalli and mohammed khadeerbabu for the wonderful reviews and shyam for the personal recommendations. We would really have .Missed the movie but for these.<br>
