I needed a custom listing to display locations of our centers on the homepage of the website for [Sambhavam](https://sambhavam-autism.com). Naturally, I wrote a .ejs file, and created a .yml for the content. The yml contents were the title, image and body, which contained the address of the center. 

Now, we have decided we need a page for each of the locations. Pages are created. I tried to link the pages to the title field in the .yml using

```
 [title](page link)

 ```

It does not work. The following works. it is working now!

```
<a href="page link">title</a>

```
